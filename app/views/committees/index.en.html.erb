<p>Committees are how Parliament examines specific issues in depth. They review bills, call expert witnesses, investigate scandals, and report all of this back to Parliament. There are many <%= link_to "different types of committees", "http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/the_facts/articles/decoding_parliamentary_commitees" %> with different roles.</p>

<p>So what happens in committee meetings?Â <%= link_to "It's not a mystery", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/committee.asp?Language=E" %>, but Citizen Factory doesn't have access to that information yet. In the meantime, here is a list of standing House of Commons committees - they're the permanent groups that oversee a specific aspect of the government. You can click on any committee to see members and subcommittees.</p>
