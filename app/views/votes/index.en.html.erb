<p>Everything that's said in the House of Commons and Senate is also transcribed: people debating a bill, Question Period, questions to cabinet ministers, everything. You can look through the transcripts from the current session of the House of Commons below.</p>

<p>MPs can vote either "yea" or "nay" on a motion, although sometimes they won't cast a vote - either because they're absent, or because they prefer to abstain as a matter of principle. MPs can also "pair" their votes. This is the Parliamentary version of the buddy system: when an MP from one party can't attend a vote, MPs from the other parties will "pair" with them to maintain the balance of power in the House of Commons.</p>
