<% @title = 'About OurParliament' %>

<p>OurParliament is a non-partisan, citizen-run project that makes Canada's parliamentary record, the <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/housechamberbusiness/ChamberSittings.aspx?View=H&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2">Hansard</a>, more accessible. Citizens require easy access to accurate and timely information about their government. This project helps Canadians better understand what's happening in Parliament.</p>

<p>Published after each sitting day and made available online at <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/">http://www.parl.gc.ca</a>, the Hansard is the official, complete report of proceedings in the House of Commons. It includes Members' speeches in debate, recorded votes, written answers to certain questions, and the Speech from the Throne at the beginning of each session of Parliament.</p>

<p>Some problems with the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/" title="Official Hansard">official Hansard</a> include inaccessibility for people with disabilities, long dowload times for dialup users, and poor design (no search, confusing navigation).</p>
