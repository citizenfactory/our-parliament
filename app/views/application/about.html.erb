<% @title = 'About Citizen Factory' %>

<p>Citizen Factory is an online tool for Canadian youth created by Apathy is Boring. Keeping tabs on elected representatives can be difficult - the information you need is scattered across various websites, archives, newspapers, blogs, and even on Twitter.</p>

<p>That's where Citizen Factory comes in: it aggregates Parliamentary information and makes it easily accessible, allowing anyone to find out exactly what Parliamentarians are doing. Citizen Factory also includes articles and resources from Apathy is Boring to help you better understand Parliament and take action.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The information in Citizen Factory is compiled from a number of different sources, ranging from the Library of Parliament to Twitter. This hard work is done by a team of magical elves, located in a secret workshop somewhere north of Baffin Island.</p>

<p>Alright, so we made up that last part. The magic behind Citizen Factory was provided by by three Montrealers: <%= link_to "Daniel Haran", "http://danielharan.com/" %>, <%= link_to "Francis Wu", "http://www.thisisfranciswu.com/" %>, and <%= link_to "Michael Lenczner", "http://www.michaellenczner.ca/" %>.</p>
