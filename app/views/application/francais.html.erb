<p>Citizen Factory is still under development - what you're looking at is the beta version. We're working hard to bring you even more features, so you can keep track of what your MP says in the House, which lobbyists they're meeting with, or the progress of bills before Parliament.</p>

<p>To do that, we need your help. Citizen Factory was launched with the generous support of the <%= link_to "Department of Canadian Heritage", "http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/about_us/sponsors" %>, but maintaining (and expanding) this website isn't free. You can support Citizen Factory, as well as Apathy is Boring's mission of using art and technology to educate Canadian youth about democracy, by <%= link_to "making a donation", "http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/about_us/donate" %>.</p>

<p>More importantly, please use Citizen Factory. Tell your friends about it. Let your MP know that you're using it to keep tabs on them. And take the next step - use the information here to take action in the democratic process and your community.</p>
