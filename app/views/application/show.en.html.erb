<h3>Welcome to Citizen Factory</h3>

<p>Parliament is confusing. That's why Citizen Factory is here - it's an online resource for Canadian youth created by <%= link_to 'Apathy is Boring', 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en' %>. Our goal is to make information about Parliament accessible and meaningful so you can understand how your government works. There are four basic elements in Citizen Factory:</p>

<%= image_tag 'sections/mps_large.png' %>
<p class="section"><%= link_to 'MPs', :controller => :members %> and <%= link_to 'Senators', :controller => :senators %> are the people who represent you in Parliament. Take a look at your MP's and Senator's profiles to see what they're doing and how you can contact them.Â </p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<%= image_tag 'sections/committees_large.png' %>
<p class="section"><%= link_to 'Committees', :controller => :committees %> are small groups of MPs and Senators who study a bill or an issue in detail, so they can make recommendations to the rest of Parliament. Find out what committees your MP is a member of.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<%= image_tag 'sections/debates_large.png' %>
<p class="section"><%= link_to 'Debates', :controller => :debates %> are where MPs spend a lot of time asking questions, contesting issues, or sometimes just taking shots at each other. Find out what your MP is saying in the House of Commons.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<%= image_tag 'sections/bills_large.png' %>
<p class="section"><%= link_to 'Votes', :controller => :votes %> on motions are held whenever Parliament wants to do something. See how your MP voted in the House of Commons.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>You can use this information to <%= link_to 'take action', 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/make_it_happen' %> as a citizen, or bring Citizen Factory into the classroom using our <%= link_to "Teacher's Guide", 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/the_facts/citizen_factory' %>.</p>
	
<h3>Parliament of Canada Website and Resources</h3>

<p>The Library of Parliament has produced a number of resources on behalf of Parliament:</p>

<p><%= link_to 'How Canadians Govern Themselves', 'http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/index-e.asp' %> by Eugene Forsey is a great way to learn all about the workings of Parliament.<br/>
<%= link_to 'Our Country, Our Parliament', 'http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Education/ESL/index-e.asp' %> is designed specifically for youth and people learning English or French to learn about Canada's Parliament.</p>

<p>They've also produced several glossaries which are more complete than our own, including:</p>
