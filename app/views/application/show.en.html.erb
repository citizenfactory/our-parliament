<h3>Welcome to Citizen Factory</h3>

<p>Parliament is confusing. That's why Citizen Factory is here - it's an online resource for Canadian youth created by <%= link_to 'Apathy is Boring', 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en' %>. Our goal is to make information about Parliament accessible and meaningful so you can understand how your government works. There are four basic elements in Citizen Factory:</p>

<p><%= link_to 'MPs', :controller => :members %> and <%= link_to 'Senators', :controller => :senators %> are the people who represent you in Parliament. Take a look at your MP's and Senator's profiles to see what they're doing and how you can contact them.Â </p>

<p><%= link_to 'Committees', :controller => :committees %> are small groups of MPs and Senators who study a bill or an issue in detail, so they can make recommendations to the rest of Parliament. Find out what committees your MP is a member of.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Debates', :controller => :hansards %> - MPs spend a lot of time asking questions, debating issues, or sometimes just taking shots at each other. Find out what your MP is saying in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Bills', :controller => :bills %> - The reason Parliament exists is to make laws, and every law starts out as a bill. Track the progress of bills being considered by Parliament and see how you MP voted on them.</p>

<p>You can use this information to <%= link_to 'take action', 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/make_it_happen' %> as a citizen, or bring Citizen Factory into the classroom using our <%= link_to "Teacher's Guide", 'http://www.apathyisboring.com/en/the_facts/citizen_factory' %>.</p>
