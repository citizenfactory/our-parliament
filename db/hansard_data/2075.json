            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present to parliament the solicitor general's annual statement on national security.\n\nPublic safety is the mission of my ministry and it has been a priority of the government since we took office. The Prime Minister has said that safe streets are one of the things that define the health of a nation.\n\nIn the Speech from the Throne the government said it would continue to work to fight criminal activity which is becoming more global in scope, including money laundering, terrorism and the smuggling of people, drugs and guns.\n\nToday I will focus on the government's response to the report of the Special Senate Committee on Security and Intelligence. The special committee, chaired by Senator Kelly, conducted a review of our security and intelligence sector and released its final report earlier this year. We studied the report and recommendations and prepared a response which I will be tabling today.\n\nI was pleased to see the strong support of the government's progress on security and intelligence matters, but the committee quite rightly pointed out that Canada like other democracies needs to stay alert to emerging threats and to take appropriate action.\n\nOur security is something that we cannot take for granted. It depends on a strong security intelligence capability, law enforcement readiness and international co-operation. Our national law and security agencies have effective mechanisms in place to meet their intelligence requirements.\n\nOn the international front Canada has been working hard with like-minded nations with the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a co-operative effort to share intelligence and deny terrorists the support and sanctuary they need for their operations.\n\nThe committee noted the close co-operation between Canada and the U.S. to ensure our special border relationship remains up to the task of detecting terrorists and organized criminals who move between our countries.\n\nThe cross-border crime forum has helped both countries improve security and law enforcement along our borders. For example, I announced last April an extra $15 million a year to post 100 more RCMP officers at three of our largest international airports. While Canada has been relatively free from terrorists attacks, in today's world we must be watchful and prepared.\n\nThe committee also praised the government's work on the national counterterrorism plan developed in co-operation with other jurisdictions. It is the key crisis management plan for responding to terrorist incidents, setting lines of communication and policy direction to guide first responders, senior government officials and ministers.\n\nThe committee was pleased with steps taken to develop the operational readiness program but noted the requirement to do more in this area. We are looking at strengthening the program to ensure a national level of readiness. Through workshops, seminars and exercises to strengthen our counterterrorism response capacity, these activities aim to raise awareness and interagency co-operation on the threat of terrorists or criminal use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons in Canada.\n\nThe threat of such use is considered low, but all jurisdictions in Canada should still have a capacity to respond to the consequences of the uses of these weapons. That is why the government will lead consultations with other jurisdictions on a national strategy to strengthen Canada's capacity to respond to potential terrorist incidents.\n\nEmerging technologies also present challenges to our efforts to ensure public safety and security. New technologies such as wireless telephones, Internet and cryptography are being used in both traditional and new types of criminal and terrorist activities. The government is dealing with this issue. Protecting Canada's critical infrastructure is a vital issue, and we are addressing it.\n\nThe government is committed to working to develop the best possible options to ensure public safety and security, but in addition to being safe Canadians need to feel that their security agencies are working well.\n\nCanada has arguably the best and most effective review and accountability framework in the world in the security intelligence sector. The Security Intelligence Review Committee, an arm's length review body, issues an annual report on CSIS operations that is tabled in parliament. The inspector general of CSIS provides an additional level of security and ministers are directly responsible to parliament.\n\nThe committee noted that the public and parliamentary awareness of the activities of our security intelligence agencies is essential in a democracy.\n\nSIRC's annual reports, this annual statement and the committee reports from the other place demonstrate important efforts to raise the knowledge and close involvement of parliament in the reviewing the security intelligence sector.\n\nAs we enter the new millennium, Canadians need to know that their government is protecting them and their national interests. I am pleased to note that the special committee recognized the significant progress made to improve our counterterrorism readiness and threat assessment capability. The chair and members of the committee should be congratulated on their hard work and on a report that highlights a number of important national security issues.\n\nIn closing, our security intelligence and police forces face many new challenges as we enter the new millennium. CSIS, the RCMP and other federal agencies are working around the clock to preserve public safety. I can assure the House that the government will continue to support them.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, as the solicitor general critic for Her Majesty's Official Opposition I find it very interesting to listen to the solicitor general's report to the House.\n\nHe reported on December 3, 1998. At that time I said that criminals involved in organized crime have successfully landed in Canada without any opposition due to our lax immigration policy and inadequate screening. Organized crime with foreign origins poses a serious threat in many metropolitan areas of Canada, particularly on the west coast.\n\nThe danger imposed by modern day organized crime is a serious and destructive force. It imperils the security of our citizens and our nation. This threat attacks us on our streets, in our businesses and in our schoolyards. Organized crime is a threat to our economic sovereignty because the cost of organized crime in our society is astronomical.\n\nThe counterattack will require additional resources, legislation and co-operation provincially, federally and internationally. Canada cannot afford the continuing lip service the government is providing to the problem. We need resources. We need action. We need it now. Canadians will feel safe and confident only when these resources are committed to this attack. Crime is organized. So should government efforts be.\n\nThose were my words exactly a year ago. Unfortunately the words of the solicitor general today belie what has happened in the intervening period of time. We have discovered in the intervening year that in the early 1990s there was a compromise of CAIPS, the computer system in our Hong Kong office. This led to very free access to organized crime to be able to move its people into our society.\n\nThere was an RCMP review of the compromise of the CAIPS system which led to the Sidewinder project, a joint project of CSIS and the RCMP. That project was making strong headway during the mid-1990s, right up to the point when CSIS decided not only to shut it down but to shred every piece of information that was in the project.\n\nCorporal Robert Read, whom I brought to the attention of the solicitor general repeatedly in the House, did a review of the review of the project and arrived at some very bad conclusions. We also understand that in 1996 CSIS lost a disk of very highly classified information in a phone booth. SIRC did the review the solicitor general has referred to in the House but interestingly the person who found the disk was never interviewed by SIRC.\n\nThis year there was a loss of a briefcase by one of the operatives of CSIS. The CSIS director informed the solicitor general but the solicitor general, in his questionable wisdom, did not inform SIRC that would be responsible for reviewing the entire disastrous affair.\n\nOn the legislative front I quote the minister on December 3, 1998 when he said “Early in the new year, 1999, the government will introduce legislation to curb money laundering”.\n\nIt did not happen early in 1999. In fact it happened in May 1999, but due to the agenda of the government that legislation ended up dying on the order paper. This vital legislation that was supposed to have been introduced, according to the words of the solicitor general, in early 1999 was finally reintroduced for passage by the House on December 15. December 15, I remind the solicitor general, is not early 1999.\n\nHe tells us he is spending $15 million to put 100 officers at international airports. That is terrific except that the province of British Columbia alone has a shortage of 500 members at this point. His $15 million for 100 officers at airports is very shallow.\n\nWe have traditions in the House. For example, a meaningful tradition is when the mace is brought into the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, followed by the Speaker. This is to say that the people of Canada have given authority to the House to do something. That is a meaningful tradition. What I am talking about now is a meaningless tradition. The meaningless tradition of this and previous Liberal solicitor generals with statements that are vacuous, meaningless mumblings simply form part of the tradition. Those are my comments.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I believe I am entitled to say today that, with the exception of the Department of Intergovernmental Affairs, the department that is the most topsy-turvy, the one that is in the most turmoil and surrounded with the most controversy, the most disliked, is the Department of the Solicitor General.\n\nReporting to the solicitor general, in addition to the department itself, are the RCMP, Correctional Services Canada, the National Parole Board, CSIS, the Office of the Correctional Investigator, the RCMP External Review Committee and the RCMP Public Complaints Commission. Out of all these, is there any one that is operating properly? One wonders.\n\nWhat, for example, is going on with our secret agents? How can our secret agents be losing documents by having their cars broken into or by leaving them in phone booths?\n\nHow could students end up being pepper sprayed during Suharto's visit to Canada? How can prisoners find it so easy to escape? How can there still be drug dealing inside our prisons? What about the mess within the National Parole Board, whose board members themselves, duly appointed by this government, are telling us that a major cleanup is needed?\n\nHow is it that the auditor general, in his most recent report of November 1999, is still obliged to call the RCMP Public Complaints Commission to task, as well as the Office of the Correctional Investigator. He comments, moreover:\n\n—both inmates and Correctional Service staff still misunderstand the role of the Office.\n\nWith a budget of $1.8 million, one might have expected inmates and staff to at least know what this office does on their behalf. It seems to me that things are far from clear. This leads me to conclude that the government is not all that clear in its supposed search for clarity. Hon. members will realize what I am getting at.\n\nLet me give an example of a clause that illustrates my point. I will read the whole thing and it will not be over until I say end of sentence.\n\nI begin:\n\n2. (1) Where the government of a province, following a referendum relating to the secession of the province from Canada, seeks to enter into negotiations on the terms of which that province might cease to be part of Canada, the House of Commons shall, except where it has determined pursuant to section 1 that a referendum question is not clear, consider and, by resolution, set out its determination on whether, in the circumstances, there has been a clear expression of a will by a clear majority of the population of that province that the province cease to be part of Canada.\n\nAll of this is a single sentence.\n\nMembers will have noticed that in that one sentence, the word clear or its derivatives is used four times. I say or its derivatives, because the term déclaré in French is a derivative of the word clair, in my opinion.\n\nI consulted a French etymological dictionary to find out if this was indeed the case. I found the dictionary of Jacqueline Picoche here, in the Library of Parliament. Ms. Picoche is a grammar research associate and has a doctorate in literature.\n\nIf we look at the word clear, we see that it has two origins, a Greek one and a Latin one. Which is most appropriate in the present case? That is the question, but I am inclined to say the Latin one. However, I would rather rely on Ms. Picoche who tells us that in Greek, the origin is kalein—and now I need my glasses—the derivative is parakalein: to call for help, hence the word paraklêtos which means lawyer, protector, comforter, intercessor. There is also another derivative, ekklêsia, assembly by convocation, then congregation of the faithful and the place where that assembly meets, hence the adjective ekklêsiastikos.\n\nThe Latin root is calare, to proclaim, convoke, from which is derived intercalare, to proclaim an additional day or month to compensate for the discrepancies in the ancient Roman calendar.\n\nThe verb calare must have had a variation, calere, from which is derived calendàe, first day of the month, and in turn calendarium, agenda. And, in low Latin, calendar must have been a feminine, plural, verbal adjective in noun form; its root cal appearing as cil when combined with other roots, producing concilium derived from concalium, convocation or assembly, from which is formed conciliabulum, meeting place, and the verbs conciliare and reconciliare, to gather and to reconcile.\n\nThe verb calare is combined with the archaic agent word calator, which appears in classical Latin as the second element, in a diminutive form, in nomenclàtor, a slave whose job it was to remind his Roman master of the names of his clients at meetings.\n\nI also have other derivatives, such as clamare, to shout, from which is derived clamor, as well as clamoris, shouting.\n\nMr. Speaker, you are signalling that I have only one minute left. But I cannot explain all this all this in one minute; it is not possible.\n\nI would also like to mention verbs like dêclamare, to speak aloud; exclamare, to exclaim; proclamare, to plead loudly; reclamare, to cry out in indignation. Then there is clarus, clear or illustrious, an adjective that must have been used originally to describe the voice or sounds and have meant suited to call.\n\nThere are also families of words such as the clarus family, which also includes the word clarine, a bell for livestock.\n\nI will close with clarifier, or clarify, which means to make clear. I hope I have been clear enough myself and that, from now on, in the House things will be unassailably clear.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, one thing is very clear. There is an astronomical void in the solicitor general's department and it begins at the top.\n\nThis document indicates quite clearly that the department is on complete auto pilot. We see meaningless comments littered throughout this document with respect to the priorities of the government and the department.\n\nWe know that cost cutting is the actual priority of the department. Although we hear time and time again about public safety being the number one priority, it has become clear that it does not even appear to rank in the top 10 when we look at this document and what is being done by the department.\n\nThere is a place in society for private security, but private security should certainly not be replacing our police forces. This seems to be a direction in which the department is headed.\n\nThe tabling of responses often comes after the fact, as we have seen in the case of leaked information in 1996 when a CSIS agent left sensitive CSIS documents on a disk in a phone booth. Almost two years later a report was filed. This report is even less relevant than the report filed on that lost information.\n\nOn the more recent leak that occurred at a hockey game in Toronto, I would think the solicitor general would be prepared to stand in his place to say “The puck stops here. I am head of this department. I will get to the bottom of this”.\n\nWe know that it took almost a month before there was any action by the department. There was no action whatsoever against the director of CSIS who was complicit with the solicitor general in keeping this information from SIRC, the watchdog that is supposed to oversee the actions of CSIS.\n\nThat information came to the attention of the head of SIRC through no other source than the Globe and Mail , which belays again the fact that quite clearly these very interconnected and supposedly co-operative departments are not co-operating at all. In fact they are operating in little fiefdoms separate from one another in an effort perhaps to try to compete for scarce resources. Perhaps they simply do not communicate because they are not getting any direction from the head of the department.\n\nThe solicitor general was armed with the information of the leak and chose not to pass that on to the head of SIRC. We know that he did not even pass it on to the Prime Minister although the Prime Minister was overseas and making comments about this not being a serious matter, that he was not too concerned about it, and that it was something that should not preoccupy Canadians. Yet he did not even have the information from the solicitor general.\n\nIt is an absolutely shocking revelation that this is going on at a time when we know that our borders and our coastlines are being inundated with the entrance of illegal immigrants and that organized crime is on the rise in this country.\n\nI spoke to a member of the RCMP from Montreal very recently who was involved in internal operations. He told me that there has been a doubling of clubhouses of Hell's Angels in and around the city of Montreal in the past six months. We know that on both coasts the same is happening. The Russian Mafia, the Asian Mafia and our age old motorcycle gangs are all on the rise. All this is going on and the solicitor general persists in contemplating cuts to detachments.\n\nWe know that for a period of time on his watch our national training facility in Saskatchewan was closed. Very recently we had the rights of RCMP advertising turned backed over from the Disney corporation. The government is running this most serious and necessary department like a Mickey Mouse operation, so it is very ironic that Disney held the rights to the department.\n\nWhat does the solicitor general do today? He comes before the House and tables a report that is littered with meaningless platitudes. A grade nine student could have come up with a better document to set out the current situation within our national security.\n\nThe solicitor general took great licence with the word “immediately” when he spoke of the theft of the documents from a car outside a hockey rink in Toronto. He told the House that he had informed the director of his department immediately. Weeks had gone by before the matter was even brought before the House, and it was not brought about because the solicitor general took any action whatsoever. Why were CSIS and and SIRC not brought to task over their handling of this? Serious communication breakdowns occurred.\n\nWe know the RCMP and CSIS do not communicate well already. Obviously the solicitor general does not communicate well with his own department or with the prime minister. We saw the worst breach of national security in 15 years. Obviously our partners outside our borders, MI5, the CIA, the FBI and other national security agencies, are looking at Canada right now with a very jaded view as a result of the way we have handled matters in the last six months.\n\nWhen will we get some accountability and some responsibility from this department and particularly this minister? It is obvious that the shortcomings of CSIS senior managers were seen directly without the discovery of the mishaps. Yet the CSIS director has had no accounting and has never appeared before a parliamentary committee with any substance. In fact when he does come, he folds his arms and says “Gee, I would like to tell you more but I would have to kill you”. This is the attitude and the type of response we get from the director of national security to members of the House who are elected to serve the people of Canada.\n\nThe former CSIS chief of strategic planning criticized the way the matter was being handled by the government. This department and this office are on complete auto pilot. This latest fiasco is an international embarrassment. There is no mention whatsoever in this document, not even an acknowledgement, that there are problems within the department. This document completely betrays the fact that this department is out of control.\n\nCSIS and the RCMP in particular have had their budgets cut to ribbons by the government. Agents and officers are working overtime and working with extremely large workloads. The National Post reported that this was the fourth time in the last four years that CSIS and the RCMP had lost documents as a result of who knows what.\n\nCanadians are worried about personal and national security. They should get little solace or little comfort from the document tabled today by the solicitor general and his hollow, meaningless comments in this regard.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to follow the comments of my hon. colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who I think stated the case quite eloquently as to the problems with this report.\n\nI taught in a university for a little while. When students did not have a whole lot to say, there were a few tricks they would use. They would take their paper and double space it, increase the size of the font and pass it in, thinking that maybe they could trick the teacher into thinking there was something of substance there.\n\nI think the solicitor general has learned the same trick, because what we have presented to us today is a seven page statement on national security that for the most part is full of rhetoric. If we want to contrast the progress of the government we should contrast it with the statement from last year.\n\nLet me talk about some of the things the solicitor general said in his statement last year. He talked about how one shipment of heroin landed successfully in Canada could lead to numerous deaths and human suffering in cities like Vancouver. My colleague from Burnaby—Douglas is here.\n\nWhat action have we seen taken to stop the importation of drugs into cities like Vancouver? Absolutely nothing. It has come to the point where my colleague who represents Vancouver East has had to stand in the House to talk about the way the drug trade in heroin is wide open like an old fashioned farmers market in the city of Vancouver. Although the government recognized the problem a year ago, not a single thing has been done.\n\nLet us look at what else was in the report from last year. Last year the solicitor general talked about creating a seamless net against organized crime. The seamless net has some pretty big holes in it, because this year we know of recent arrests and that a major organized crime ring dealing in bank and credit card fraud has been exposed.\n\nHow are Canadians expected to feel secure when the ports on both coasts and the border along the United States are not safe from organized crime? We know this is happening because even with its limited resources the RCMP has exposed rings that are using debit cards in fraud and are importing drugs into cities like Vancouver and Halifax. My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has mentioned the motorcycle gangs that have increased in cities like Montreal.\n\nWhen it comes to personal safety Canadians have every right to be concerned. When it comes to combating organized crime the people who live along our borders and coasts have every right to ask the government what measures it has taken to protect them. In reality, the measures taken have been to cut and gut the RCMP.\n\nMy colleagues from Kamloops, Regina and Burnaby have had to stand in the House to pressure and plead with the solicitor general to ensure that programs in Regina like the training centre for the RCMP not be shut down. My colleagues from Burnaby and Kamloops have had to stand in the House to plead for additional funding so their communities could have some RCMP presence where there are perhaps one or two for thousands of citizens.\n\nThis is what the government calls a statement on national security. National security is in real trouble. I made the point two years ago that the disbandment of the ports police would lead to an infestation of drugs on either side of the country through the ports. Cutting the RCMP, disbanding the ports police, and leaving it to our customs officers who have also been gutted in the government's race to build a surplus to try to deal with a sophisticated and powerful international network of organized crime just does not cut it. It does not cut it for the Canadians who live in Montreal, Halifax, Vancouver, Burnaby, Windsor, or anywhere along the border with the United States where we know that organized crime is winning the war.\n\nI suppose I thank the solicitor general for tabling his report. However, as I said, sometimes I would get such papers when I was teaching in university and unfortunately with the double spacing, the large font and because it does not say much, it would get a failing grade. At this point I think that is what Canadian citizens would have to give the government.",

An exhaustive list of the bands involved in negotiations must be published.\n\nSecond, in order to prove the government's good faith, provisional agreements must be negotiated and in place by the spring of 2000.\n\nThe point I would like to add before concluding is that the keystone of the Marshall decision is the notion of moderate livelihood. The report does not go far enough in this regard.\n\nI ask that the department responsible for aboriginal affairs determine who is going to co-ordinate the examination of the concept of moderate livelihood. I would like to know what the parameters will be, and the timetable for this.\n\nAs a matter of parliamentary privilege, next time around, I would appreciate it if more budget were allocated to the Standing Committee on Fisheries so that a translator can also be assigned to us when the committee travels. Extra effort was required of Bloc members to work in both languages on a very specialized subject, because the vocabularies differ greatly from one language to the other.",

I would like to thank the member for Lakeland for seconding my firearms law sunset act. I would also like to thank Canadians from coast to coast, right across Canada, who have supported this bill.\n\nFor the last 20 years government has established an unimpressive track record of passing costly, ineffective gun control laws. When its ineffective laws do not reduce the criminal use of firearms, it passes more ineffective gun control laws.\n\nThe firearms law sunset act which I am introducing today guarantees that scarce tax dollars will only be spent on gun control measures that actually work. My sunset law would require the automatic repeal of any gun control measure after five years from the date of implementation, unless it can pass the public safety test administered by the Auditor General of Canada which proves the measure is cost effective in achieving its stated objective.\n\nI believe all laws that we pass in the House must be cost effective at achieving this goal. Sunset provisions are the only way of guaranteeing this.\n\n(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)",

Conditions of the loan are summarized as follows: the maximum term is ten years; the cost of loan is either prime rate plus 1% or at a fixed rate equal to the residential mortgage rate plus 1%; loans must not exceed 80% of the value of the asset being financed; the maximum loan is $250,000.\n\nFruit growers can plant now, pay later through an FCC loan.\n\nFarm Credit Corporation, FCC, has expanded the plant now pay later loan to include all fruit and berry varieties grown for commercial production across Canada. This unique loan was originally introduced in 1996 to help vineyard expansion projects in Ontario and British Columbia. Fruit growers can use the loan to renovate or expand orchards, vineyards, berry farms or other types of production that take several years to yield a comercial crop. The loan allows clients to better manage their cash flow. It offers flexible terms and conditions to match production cycles and an amortization period that matches the life cycle of farms.\n\nRepayment options include total payment deferral for up to three years or interest only payments for the first five years. With the deferral option, no payments are required in the first three growing seasons including the replant year. Interest that accrues during this period is capitalized at the end of the third growing season. in year four, an interest only payment is made and in year five blended payments begin with up to 20 years to repay. For example, a loan of $25,000 accrues approximately $5,000 of interest in three years. Thus at the end of three years, the loan becomes $30,000. Payments are then based on this loan amount and may be made annually. The loan covers all planting costs including the costs of drainage, land improvement, plants, planting costs, trellising, irrigation and maintenance in the first three years.\n\nThose eligible for the loan include producers of grapes, apples and pears, tender fruit trees, including peaches, nectarines, apricots, cherries and plums, and all berries, including rasberries, blueberries, saskatoon berries and cranberries.\n\nThe plant now pay later loan was initiated through consultation with primary producers and agricultural groups to develop an innovative lending product that addresses specific financing needs.\n\nQuestion No. 18—",

Federal and provincial statutes, as well as the actions of governmental actors, have been challenged before all manner of administrative tribunal and before every level of court. All the information that has been requested is contained in publicly available documents. The Department of Justice does not keep specific statistics on the number of federal laws that have been challenged in the courts for alleged violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms since 1982. For example, to determine the federal position in each of these cases, it would be necessary to conduct a manual search of the Department of Justice files on each particular case, at each level of court.\n\nAdditional sources of information which may be of assistance are: the Canadian Charter of Rights Decisions Digest, a digest of important Charter cases, is available on line at the following Internet site: http://canada.justice.gc.ca/Publications/CCDL/deveng/charterdigest/cdtoc.htm. http://www.law.utoronto.ca/conlit/biblioq2.htm#A4.1 is another useful Internet site for research on the charter.\n\nQuick law QL provides two relevent databases:\n\nCRC—charter of rights cases. Summaries of court decisions on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms from 1982 to 1992.\n\nCJ—Canadian Judgments. Global database. Contains full text of the Supreme Court of Canada, SCC, judgments since 1985, SCJ—supreme court judgements and full text of decisions of most provincial court cases since 1986.\n\nConsultations may also be conducted at the University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive N.W., Calgary, Alberta, T2N 1N4. The Law Library is located on the main floor, Professional Faculties Building B, telephone (403) 220-7274. Also noteworthy is the Law Society Library, Queen's Bench, located on the 7th floor, 611—4th Street S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 1T5 and can be reached at telephone (403) 297-6148.\n\nAcademic consideration of the charter and its impact in Canada is substantial. The hon. member may find an article by Professors F.L. Morton et al. entitled “Judicial Nullification of Statutes Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982-88” (1990), 28 Alta L. Rev. 396 to be of particular interest. The article assesses the effect of the charter on federal and provincial legislation and analyses all reported federal and provincial appellate decisions between 1982-88 in which a statute was declared wholly or partially invalid due to a charter violation. The hon. member may also wish to consult David Schneiderman & Kate Sutherland, Charting the Consequences: The Impact of Charter Rights on Canadian Law and Politics (Toronto: 1997).\n\nCanadian Heritage\n\n(c) Since its inception in 1978, the scope and mandate of the court challenges program has evolved significantly. Originally established to fund test cases on constitutionally protected language rights, the program today covers charter equality based challenges of legislation, programs and policies of the federal government as well as federal and provincial legislation, policies and programs involving constitutionally protected language rights. The program has been administered at arm's length from government by five consecutive managing organizations. By negotiated agreement, the closed files were sealed and sent to Public Archives and cannot be accessed by government. As a consequence, except for illustrative individual cases incorporated in the court challenges program annual reports, it is impossible to identify court cases that received financial assistance from the program. Those annual reports are public and can be found in public libraries.\n\n(d) Since it is not possible to identify individual cases having received financial assistance from the court challenges program, one can only speculate on the effective impact of such funding on the jurisprudence trend in the areas of linguistic and equality rights. The evaluation report of the program for the period 1994-97 presents the most comprehensive assessment of impact for the review period and very few court cases are identified in its pages. To obtain a copy of this report, write to the Department of Canadian Heritage at 15 Eddy Street, Hull, Quebec K1A 0M5 or call (819) 997-0055.\n\nQuestion No. 34—",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, 11 years ago when I was first elected, the then Leader of the Official Opposition told me that I should spend the first few years of my political career listening to the people of Canada, travelling the country region by region, understanding the issues and appreciating the diversity of opinion which is expressed daily throughout our country. For the past 11 years I have done just that.\n\nI have been across the country many times and have spoken with thousands of Canadians from every region and every walk of life. For me it has been a continuous national dialogue. In fact, it is their stories and their voices that have inspired me to make a long term commitment to a larger cause, that is, preserving the hope of Canadians that tomorrow can indeed be better than today and more important, that we all have an obligation to make it so.\n\nAs we prepare to welcome in a new century, there is much to celebrate about Canada. We have shown the world how to balance freedom with compassion and tradition with innovation, how to provide health care to all our citizens and how to treat our senior citizens with the respect and dignity they deserve. In a world darkened by conflicts that literally tear nations apart, our country has stood as an example of how people of different cultural backgrounds can live and work together in harmony.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that Canada's greatest strength is in fact her people, the people who have settled and developed this country. Thanks to their imagination and determination, Canada has always moved forward, going from being an agrarian society to a leading industrial power during and after the second world war.\n\nOur country has continued to push ahead with innovation in the years since, capturing leadership positions in such areas as telecommunications, aerospace and information technology.\n\nAll of this does not mean that we have not had our challenges, but what it does mean is that every time we have been challenged as a country the people of Canada have risen to the challenge.\n\nIt was not long ago that the international community doubted our ability to remain a player in the global economy. I am sure we all remember in the House in 1994 when the Wall Street Journal compared us to a third world economy. We as Canadians could have given up, but we did not. That is not the Canadian way. Instead, we rolled up our sleeves and we turned our country around. We made an impressive comeback.\n\nToday we have the best fiscal health of the G-7. We have eliminated a $42 billion deficit. We have balanced our books. We are paying down our public debt. We have begun to lower taxes. Our inflation rate is the lowest since the 1960s. Our interest rates are also the lowest in decades and, thanks to a dynamic private sector, over 1.7 million jobs have been created since the government took office in 1993.\n\nWhat a difference six years have made. Recently the Financial Times of London referred to Canada as the top dog of the G-7. We are doing much better.\n\nIn the new global economy there is really not too much time to stop and congratulate ourselves on our success. Canadians know that. That is why they want an agenda that will see them enjoy more opportunity, a higher standard of living and an even better quality of life in the new century. In order to achieve all this, however, we need a clear vision for the future.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Canada stands at the threshold of a new century. Within a few days our nation will enter a new era, a new millennium.\n\nThis fall marked the sixth time that the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance sought the advice of Canadians in advance of the federal budget. It was the third time that I participated as chair of the committee. In a very short time I have seen the mood of the country and Canadians change, becoming increasingly optimistic about the prospects of the future.\n\nThe committee's report, entitled “Budget 2000—New Era—New Plan”, is the result of our continuing conversations with Canadians, a national dialogue that has helped us to understand our fellow citizens' values and priorities and how the federal budget should reflect them.\n\nCanadians want an agenda that will see them enjoy more opportunities, a higher standard of living. In order to achieve all this we have put together, through our prebudget consultation report, a road map that will in fact achieve this vision. This plan fosters sound financial management, promotes economic growth and a better standard of living by cutting taxes, makes our economy more competitive and ensures that Canadians will enjoy greater security and expanded opportunities. It is my hope that this plan will inspire Canadians to confidently believe that indeed tomorrow can be better than today.\n\nWhile conducting our prebudget consultation the finance committee heard from a broad range of witnesses. We listened to organizations representing businesses, children, industry, arts, culture and farmers. We heard from educators, health care workers, economists and individual municipalities. We reached out to every single section of this great country.\n\nThe committee crossed Canada and spoke with advocates who said that we need greater support for the homeless, public transportation and research and development. Very importantly, we met with individual Canadians from coast to coast to coast.\n\nAt this point I really ought to be thanking the members of parliament who held town hall meetings across the country and who took the time to listen to their constituents, as well as the members of the committee who worked very hard to put the report together.\n\nI also want to say that I firmly believe that this report clearly reflects the values and priorities of Canadians.\n\nCanadians are very happy with the fact that we have ended an era of skyrocketing deficits and public debt for good, that we have brought down back to back balanced budgets for the first time since 1951-52, and that we have put the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track. The fiscal turnaround, coupled with low inflation and interest rates, has really helped this country to create over 1.7 million jobs and to bring back prosperity to the people of Canada.\n\nThere was also very strong support for measures taken by the government, whether we are referring to the $16.5 billion tax cut that was introduced or the investments we have made in innovation and skills development through the Canada foundation for innovation and the Canada millennium scholarship fund. There was also very strong support from the people of Canada for the extra commitment made by the government to provide an additional $11.5 billion over five years to the provinces and territories specifically for health care.\n\nOne of the issues that was raised often and was strongly supported was the national child benefit, not to mention the appreciation of Canadians for the government modernizing the employment insurance program.\n\nThe committee is committed to making sure that we are never going to let the nation's finances get out of control again. We will keep the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track.\n\nThe committee also introduced a multi-year plan for tax reduction, which I will elaborate later.\n\nThe role of government is to continue to create opportunities for Canadians, to access foreign markets and to promote Canada as an ideal place in which to invest.\n\nThe people of Canada also called for further investment for lifelong learning to continue to build the most highly skilled workforce in the world, and that is one of the greatest advantages that this country has in the knowledge based economy.\n\nLet us talk about an issue that is extremely important to the people of Canada, that is, the issue of health care. In the 1999 budget, as I said earlier, the government made the largest single new investment since coming to office by committing $11.5 billion over five years. As well, the Prime Minister chaired the national forum on health and implemented key recommendations of the forum, including the health transition fund, the Canada health information service, the community action program for children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. These programs and the balanced approach by the government to these issues were also applauded by the people of Canada.\n\nOne of the greatest resources a country has is its people.\n\nWe have the thrust of the Canada opportunities strategy, a comprehensive plan to provide Canadians with greater and more affordable access to education and skills, the millennium scholarship fund, the tax relief on interest payments on student loans, the Canada education savings grant, the work done on SchoolNet, which has connected every public school and library in Canada to the Internet, the first nation in the world to accomplish this, the community access program, which will have public Internet sites connected to 10,000 rural and urban sites by the year 2000, and computers for schools, whose goal is to provide 250,000 computers for Canadian schools by the year 2000, which is 60% complete. These measures taken by the government have certainly been welcomed.\n\nThe issue of children and families came up during the prebudget consultation hearings. There was support for the national child benefit. Many referred to it as the most innovative of national social programs in this generation. Many other projects like the aboriginal head start initiative, the Canadian prenatal nutrition program and the community action program for children were also supported.\n\nI will put this debate in its proper context. In my opening remarks I talked about a higher standard of living for Canadians. There is a responsibility on the part of government to use all of its levers to make sure that Canadians will enjoy a higher standard of living and a better quality of life in the new millennium. It is important to have a well set and well thought out strategy to achieve these ends.\n\nThe government, as is reflected in the prebudget consultation report “A new era—A new plan”, has those levers. We as members of the committee ask the government to act on these particular issues.\n\nIf we want to generate the type of wealth and the type of economic growth required to address all the social issues and challenges we heard about from coast to coast to coast, then there is no question in my mind that the only way we can do that is to put a plan together that speaks to the issue of improving the standard of living for people.\n\nWhat are the components of this strategy? Where should the government go to make sure that we as individual Canadians will enjoy a higher standard of living?\n\nLet us look at fiscal and monetary policy. If there is one area in which this government has done well, and about which we can say we are heading in the right direction, it is the area of fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nCanadians may ask why it is an important component of the finance committee's strategy to improve the standard of living for Canadians. A stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation brings lower interest rates and boosts confidence. It encourages investment, which enhances productivity growth and boosts employment.\n\nIt is very clear that any government, here in Canada or abroad, must get those fundamentals right. As we enjoy the low interest rates and the great boom we have had in employment growth, we must recognize that this is not something we do on a part time basis. We must remain vigilant. We must make sure that the debt continues to go in a downward projection because it is very important not only for Canadians but people throughout the world to recognize that Canada has its economic fundamentals right.\n\nWhat have been the accomplishments of the government? The deficit has been eliminated. We now have a surplus. This is one of the major reasons we travelled across the country seeking input and asking Canadians what the priorities should be, what were their values as Canadians and where we should make investments.\n\nAs I stated earlier the debt to GDP ratio is clearly on a downward path. It is also important to note that provinces have had substantial fiscal progress in the past five years, not to mention that we are benefiting from the low inflation of the 1990s.\n\nWhat does this mean to everyday Canadians? When Canadians renewed their mortgages they understood the actual meaning. They understood the difference between the theory of fiscal responsibility and the practice. Throughout the country people are happy with the fact that they are finally regaining some financial freedom to make decisions that are right for them and their families.\n\nAnother lever the federal government has to deal with is the issue of taxation policy. Everywhere we went throughout the country, whether I was talking with someone in a coffee shop or at my local parish or visiting workers in factories it did not matter to whomever I spoke. Canadians want tax cuts and Canadians deserve tax cuts.\n\nWhy is that? It is because Canadians have worked very hard for a number of years to defeat the deficit. It is thanks to the hard work of Canadians that today we enjoy a surplus. It is right for the federal government to help Canadians restore some of their lost disposable income.\n\nWith the exception of the past two or three years during which people have begun to feel the impact of federal government policies, they have seen their incomes go up. It is also important to note that for the past 10 years the average disposable income in Canada has gone down. It is our responsibility as members of the House, trusted legislators of the country, to restore some of that disposable income so Canadians can begin to understand that their sacrifices are rewarded.\n\nTax policy in a country that is dedicated to improving the standard of living of people is extremely important. Taxes can affect the allocation of resources and alter the incentives to work, to save and to invest. I emphasize this point because it is part of the $46 billion tax cut plan the finance committee tabled in the House of Commons. It is important to understand the components of the plan because they take into consideration that tax cuts should not only cater to a section of Canadian society. Tax cuts belong to all Canadians.\n\nWhat did the finance committee that is reflecting the needs, desires and aspirations of Canadians say about tax cuts? The first measure was to increase the basic and spousal amounts by 15%, raising the limit to $8,200. That is the amount of money people can earn tax free.\n\nWhy is this news so great for Canadians? It is because over half a million people will not be paying taxes any more. They will be off the tax rolls as a result of this measure. Is that important? It is. I have spoken to those individuals who are paying taxes on relatively low incomes. It is not who says what that really makes the difference. We have to do what is right for the people of Canada.\n\nWhen we increase the thresholds by 15%, when we increase them from $29,000 to $34,000 and $60,000 to $68,000, what are we doing? In technical terms we are compensating for inflation. We are reducing marginal tax rates. We are reducing the one earner-two earner tax disparity. What is really important is that it is fair. Canadians will benefit from it. Canadians will have more money in their pockets to realize their dreams and their families dreams.\n\nThey also appreciate that if they work hard, take risks and make the necessary effort in a country like Canada then they will be rewarded. When this type of philosophy takes hold and when governments reflect the thrust of the argument I have outlined, I sense that there will be energy within the people of Canada to become more entrepreneurial and take greater risks because they know they will be rewarded for their efforts.\n\nIn many speeches in the House we talk about Canada's hard working middle class. We have to put our words into action. For this reason the finance committee recommended that we reduce the middle tax rate by three percentage points to 23% over the next five years. This will lower the taxes paid by middle income Canadians. This point has been raised in every town hall meeting that members of parliament have held across the country.\n\nWe must also eliminate the 5% surtax by gradually increasing the threshold. Why does the finance committee want the surtax to be eliminated? There can be tax reform and tax cuts but in this case it is also the issue of governance. The surtax was introduced when we were in a deficit position. Now that we have a balanced budget, now that we have a surplus, we as legislators must get rid of the surtax because it makes great economic sense but it is also a question of governance, of acting on a promise that was made.\n\nFamilies and children are very important to the social and economic fibre of the country. Any budget that does not address this issue would fail. It is for this reason that the finance committee once again made a recommendation which would lower over a five year period the CTB phaseout rate by one-half to 2.5% for families with more than one child and 1.25% for families with one child.\n\nThat is kind of a technical version of this recommendation. What this means in real life is that more families will be helped to raise their children, that more families will have greater disposable income to do what they need to do. They will have more disposable income to get ahead and to make the personal wise investments they need to make.\n\nI also want to be very clear that on these issues I have been talking about the personal side—",

I have had recourse to the Annotated Standing Orders of the House of Commons where, if hon. members looked, they would see it is stated quite clearly that in instances where the parliamentary secretary makes the first speech on behalf of the government, he or she has unlimited time, as well as the opposition member replying immediately thereafter.\n\nI am aware that the hon. member is not the parliamentary secretary. The difficulty with the position advanced by the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is that the member speaking immediately after the minister would be the hon. member for Vaughan—King—Aurora. He would therefore have unlimited time on that guise if he were not the first person speaking for the government.\n\nThe hon. member would find himself in the position where the hon. member for Vaughan—King—Aurora would have unlimited time because he is the first person speaking in reply to the government, and then the opposition would not get a similar opportunity. In the opinion of the Chair, this is not the result that should obtain in this case. In the opinion of the Chair, there should be two speeches of unlimited time.\n\nAccordingly, I feel that it is appropriate that even though the member is not the parliamentary secretary, it has been the practice consistently in the use of this rule that when a government motion is moved, the first person speaking has unlimited time, as does the second.\n\nThe hon. member for Vaughan—King—Aurora is the first person speaking on the motion. Accordingly, I believe the ruling that he has unlimited time is correct in the circumstances. I propose, since we have already exceeded the 20 minutes by some measure, to allow him to complete his speech.",

I do not want to lose the opportunity to say that this particular measure will extend the number of families that will benefit from it. It will also bring in many more middle class families that have not been able to access the Canada child tax benefit. This will literally help millions of families.\n\nMost of my comments this morning have dealt with the personal side of taxation. We live in a globally competitive economy. Business, commerce, is very much a part of our everyday existence as a nation. Budgets should also take into consideration the important role businesses play in our economy.\n\nIt is for that reason the finance committee for example would like to reduce EI premiums by 40 cents over four years. At maturity this would be a $3.1 billion cut. It will reduce the marginal tax rates. It will reduce the amount of profit insensitive taxes faced by business. Workers will also benefit from this cut. We need to begin with some profound reform of the business tax system and we say that.\n\nWe also would like to increase the RRSP limit by a total of $2,000 over a five year period. We want to lower the general corporate rate by five percentage points over five years. This will help restore tax neutrality. It will provide our businesses with greater international competitiveness and it will stop penalizing new economy firms.\n\nOther measures in this tax package include increasing the foreign content from 20% to 30%. This will increase returns to retirement savings at reduced risk. We also want to lower the inclusion rate for donation of appreciable property which will promote charitable giving, consider expanding eligible properties for a lower inclusion rate, and as I said earlier, also work with the provinces to establish a common capital tax base.\n\nGiven the fact that I am very sensitive to the time I have taken thus far, I would like to say that this $46 billion tax cut package is clearly an indication to the people of Canada and the businesses of the country that this government, or this committee, is very serious about establishing a competitive tax regime, about rewarding Canadians for their effort.\n\nOnly because I am mindful of the time, I will end now and say very simply that “Budget 2000—New Era, New Plan”, the report of the finance committee, is an excellent road map. I hope the Minister of Finance will seriously consider its elements.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise again and debate the issue of the prebudget report of the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nYesterday I stood and delivered a speech which I thought was my response to this issue but as it turned out, it was not. Nevertheless I am happy to be here again today to address some of the issues that my friend has raised and which are contained in the report.\n\nThe first point I want to make is the same one I made yesterday. The basis of the entire report is a faulty one. It is so glaring a contradiction it is almost surprising that my friend across the way and other Liberal members of parliament are able to stand in this place and make a spirited case for what they believe in. It is that bold.\n\nThe essence of the contradiction is that on the one hand the government is calling for a $46 billion in tax relief, which of course is laudable and the Reform Party completely and unequivocally supports that. In fact we have championed tax relief for 12 years, ever since we came into being. I am proud of that fact and I would like to think we have helped influence the government to start to think about these things. The contradiction is that on the one hand the government calls for tax relief of that scale, and on the other hand it says it will maintain its 50:50 spending promise, which means that 50% of any future surplus would go to new program spending.\n\nThe government cannot have it both ways. It cannot have its cake and eat it too. Government members cannot speak out of both sides of their mouths, but that is what they are trying valiantly to do. We cannot let them get away with that. It is double-talk. That is all there is to it. It is just an attempt to win over all the various constituencies at once, even though they are recommending things that are completely contradictory. They cannot get away with that.\n\nThis is a pattern from the government. We have seen it over and over again. I would categorize it as Liberal rhetoric versus the Liberal record. We see completely different things when we compare the record to the rhetoric. The Liberals speak on one level that is completely disconnected from the reality the rest of the country has to live with. It is as though they are in court somewhere completely cut off from the rest of the population. I would suggest that is exactly the case. I think it was reflected in the statement the member for Vaughan—King—Aurora just delivered in the House.\n\nI want to run through the Liberal record to underline what I have just said. When we run through the bare facts, people will see very clearly that what my friend has just delivered here in the House was a lot of rhetoric. He can say all he wants about how he feels it is important to cut taxes, to be more productive as a country, to deal with the debt as an important issue and to re-allocate spending because we do not want to see money wasted on projects that are not important. He can say those things, but if he never does anything about them, they are empty words. They are hollow husks. I submit that is exactly the case here.\n\nI want to run through some of the facts so that members in this place and people watching can draw their own conclusions.\n\nMy friend said that he wants to see tax relief and he has made an argument for that. I remind members that the government has been in power for six years, that we have had a balanced budget for two and a half years going on to three years now, but still we have had no tax relief. I know my friends across the way will say that we have had tax relief. It is simply not so. Here are the facts.\n\nThe OECD in its reports that came out in June and September said that Canada must cut taxes, that taxes in Canada are growing with every passing day. Three or four days before the finance minister delivered his fiscal and economic update in November, the economics branch of the Toronto Dominion Bank delivered a report. It showed that the federal government today takes more money out of people's pockets than any federal government has ever taken in the history of Canada. It showed an upward trend too. In fact that will be realized on January 1 when the government helps Canadians celebrate the new millennium with a tax hike.\n\nWe will see the Canada pension plan taxes go up on January 1. We will also see income taxes go up because of bracket creep. Canadians will be poorer. The federal coffers will be enriched. Unfortunately that is bad news for Canadians.\n\nIt puts the lie to what we have heard in this place, which is that the government is somehow committed to lowering taxes. It is completely the contrary. What we are seeing are taxes ever ramping upward. That is a shameful fact, but it is a fact.\n\nIn Canada today the average family spends more on taxes than it does on food, shelter and clothing. That is the Liberal record versus the Liberal rhetoric. It is a fact that in Canada today disposable income languishes. It has barely grown since the recession of the 1990s and it is barely above where it stood in 1980.\n\nCanadians are paying a dear price for the high tax record of the government. When it says that it wants to cut taxes, we know by its actions that tax cutting is very low on its priority list.\n\nI want to talk about the government's record on the debt. In Canada today we have a debt of $577 billion. That is a staggering amount of money, 64% of GDP, which is one of the highest levels of debt to GDP in the industrialized world, only behind Italy in the G-7.\n\nWe also point out that in Canada today the finance minister cuts a cheque for $40 billion a year to pay the interest on the debt. That $40 billion is by far the largest payment that the government makes of any kind. Old age security is about $23 billion or $24 billion a year. That is our most expensive social program. Of course, the transfers to the provinces for health care and education are much lower than that, certainly a lot lower after the government cut transfers dramatically. They are around $15 billion a year, much lower than what we pay in interest on the debt.\n\nThe impact of that is that Canadians have to pay a big chunk of their taxes toward the interest on the debt. One would think that if the government truly was concerned about helping Canadians and ensuring the long term fiscal stability of the country that it would have some kind of plan to pay down the debt. What is its plan?\n\nThe plan is that if there is any money left over after it has gone on its spending sprees, then it will pay down some debt. We have the situation now where, after having run on paper what should have been big surpluses, the government has paid down $3 billion one year and $3 billion another year toward the debt.\n\nAt that rate it will take approximately 190 years to deal with the problem of the debt. I do not think Canadians want to wait that long. I think they want to deal with this issue now.\n\nThe federal government should take a look at what happened in Alberta, where the government poured billions upon billions of dollars into beating down a huge debt, the result being that it has one of the healthiest economies in Canada and in North America. In Alberta we are seeing jobs created with every passing day. People are coming from across the country to enjoy the fruits of the Alberta advantage. It truly is a spectacular and amazing success story. My friends across the way should pay attention because they would learn a tremendous amount.\n\nMy friends mentioned health care in Alberta. I point out that even despite the big cuts of the federal government, which shut down hospitals across the country and forced people to recuperate in hallways, the Government of Alberta has actually raised its health care spending to record heights. Alberta has never spent more money on health care than it spends today. That is because of the dramatic improvement in the fiscal situation in the province of Alberta, due to the actions of the provincial government, not the actions of this government.\n\nI want to talk about the spending record of the government. Today in Canada, and this may surprise some people, according to the national accounts, all levels of government are spending more money per person than has ever been spent before. That is a very important point to make because when we have the debate about what to do with the surplus that is coming our way, many people, including members of the Liberal government, say that we have to increase spending dramatically. The government has the 50:50 promise which, if enacted, and let us hope it does not keep this promise either, would mean $47 billion in new spending.\n\nWe saw the headlines in the National Post . Amazingly, that was the same number that the 50:50 formula would lead us to if it were ever enacted.\n\nForty-seven billion dollars in spending is a tremendous amount, but according to the national accounts for all levels of government, we have never spent more per person in Canada on program spending than we are spending today. I would argue that Canada does not need more spending because we have never spent more.\n\nWe know that relative to other countries in the world we spend a tremendous amount on programs of various kinds. I would argue that if we have a big surplus coming our way and we have a tremendous debt burden and extraordinarily high taxes, then it makes sense to devote that money to lowering our debt and our tax burden. To me that makes sense. I do not see why we would need to go beyond the record high levels of spending in which we are already engaging. Just because we are spending all that money does not mean we could not spend it a lot better.\n\nWhen I look at how this government spends, one of the things that concerns me the most is its willingness to sacrifice necessary things to unnecessary things, or high priority things to low priority things.\n\nWhy does the government insist upon spending billions of dollars in grants and subsidies for its political friends, while farmers, for instance, in the prairies are left wanting? It makes no sense. Why do my friends across the way insist on spending billions of dollars on empire building for huge bureaucracies that do not deliver any kind of service to the public, but which burn up all that money, when those funds could be used for good things like health care, education and restoring funding to defence?\n\nIt is a shame that on the one hand the government stands at every opportunity to take a bow for the work of our peacekeeping troops around the world, while on the other hand it punishes them by putting them into perilous situations without proper equipment. That has to be the most hypocritical thing I have ever seen, but the government does it day after day.\n\nIt is profoundly wrong that the government cloaks itself in the proud heritage of the RCMP on the one hand, while on the other hand it deprives it of the basic tools it needs to do the job. We see more and more that investigations are being called off because of cost. There is not enough money to finish the investigations.\n\nMy colleague from Kootenay—Columbia is constantly pointing these things out in the House of Commons, but sadly the government does not get the message. It burns up billions of dollars in wasteful areas and at the same time deprives necessary programs of proper funding, which is fundamentally wrong.\n\nAs someone once said, those things that matter most should never be at the mercy of those things that matter least. We should engrave that over the doorways of the offices of many federal departments because sadly that happens all too often.\n\nHere is more on Liberal rhetoric versus the Liberal record. I want to talk about productivity. My friend, the chair of the finance committee, gave an impassioned speech in this place about why we need to be more productive. He said that the government is doing all kinds of things. But consider this. If the government is so concerned about productivity, why did the finance minister in his 1995 budget speech announce that he would be hiring all kinds of auditors to audit businesses across the country in order to scrape every nickel out of them, when they were trying desperately to simply make a go of it?\n\nMy friend from Lakeland has raised the following issue in the past, and he knows it is a fact because he has constituents coming to him about it, as do I. They tell us that they are being harassed by Revenue Canada. People who have never had a problem with any kind of late payment are suddenly subject to incredible, ridiculous scrutiny by people from Revenue Canada, and they are tied up for days and days and weeks and weeks.\n\nWe know about the chiropractor in Winnipeg who faced a negative judgment by the tax courts. Revenue Canada's people swooped down on his home, even taking the cereal out of the cupboard. They took his 12 year old son's award for heroism, which was given to him by the governor general. That is the real record of the government.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I assert that it is true. I would be happy to talk with my friend about it later.\n\nThat is only one example.\n\nIf we want to talk about productivity and helping business, we should consider the situation in Alberta of Mr. Nickerson. Mr. Nickerson mortgaged his home and his farm to purchase a limousine from the United States, which he transformed and now calls the longhorn limo. He brought the vehicle into Canada to rent it out. He was making a living.\n\nThe limousine passed the Alberta transportation safety inspection standards with flying colours. All of a sudden, the people at Transport Canada got wind that Mr. Nickerson had become a successful entrepreneur and they decided to impound his limousine. They are not convinced that it will pass certain safety standards. They will not tell him what the specific problem is. In fact, the bureaucrat who made the decision, Mr. Boily, decided that he would impound the car without having seen it for himself and without providing any kind of detail on what exactly was the problem.\n\nThis man basically mortgaged his entire life savings for this business and now the government has snatched his dream away with absolutely no explanation. Mr. Boily, who is 2,000 miles away, will go home tonight and sit down with his family for dinner. It is no sweat off his nose. But in Alberta, Mr. Nickerson has to live with friends because he has lost his business.\n\nThis is the type of arbitrary, ridiculous regulation and bureaucracy that people in this country run into all too often. It is shameful that members across the way would sit and mock this situation. It is shameful and they should be embarrassed.\n\nProgram after program which the government brings forward retards productivity in Canada. The Liberals talk about a productivity covenant. Virtually all of what members on the other side do in some way gets in the way of business and making the country more productive. Liberals find ways to build massive bureaucracies which take days, weeks and months to make decisions which people in the business world would make in a few minutes. That slows things down. Is it any wonder we trail the United States when it comes to productivity?\n\nThis has been pointed out by the Minister of Industry. My friend across the way is heckling. Let him heckle the Minister of Industry. He has pointed to the fact that Canada is falling further and further behind the United States when it comes to productivity. This means that our standard of living is falling as well. Friends across the way know it. They are upset. I have obviously touched a very sensitive area. They are very upset about this.\n\nIf the Liberals are concerned they should talk to the Minister of Industry because he raised it first in this place. The minister pointed out that if our standard of living and our rate of economic growth had stayed even with those of the United States over the last many years, the average family of four in Canada would have a standard of living $28,000 higher than it is today. That is $7,000 a person. My friend across the way doubts it, but I invite him to talk to the industry minister because he raised it in this place.\n\nWhat is the impact of all this horrible Liberal record on Canadians? It is absolutely devastating.\n\nI will read into the record a couple of letters that I have received from people across the country who are concerned about where the government is going on the issue of taxes. The first letter is from a gentleman from Clarenville, Newfoundland. He writes:\n\nI understand you were interested in how much taxes Canadians were paying. Have a look at this. I work at the oil refinery at Come-By-Chance, Newfoundland. Last month there was an error in my paycheque due to a mix-up in the number of hours I had worked. When the mix-up was straightened out, payroll issued me a separate cheque to make up the difference. They owed for eight hours regular time and sixteen hours overtime. My gross pay came to $801.92. There was $536.20 taken out for income tax and $10.42 for union dues. My net pay was $255.30. This is a tax rate of 67%.\n\nI invite my friend over there, who thinks of himself as an expert on these things, to come and check the pay stub because he is welcome to do it.",

Over the course of a year, the hon. member knows what the story is.\n\nI will read another letter from a gentleman from Montrose, B.C. who writes:\n\nI have enclosed a copy of my two most recent pay stubs. I think they stand as a good example of how high taxation rates in Canada can be a disincentive to productive workers.\n\nThis is unbelievable, and I know my friend across the way will heap scorn on it because it is profoundly embarrassing to his government, but I will read on.\n\nDuring the two week period ending November 5, 1999, I was paid for 40 hours work, while in the following period, I was paid for 40.5 hours work, having put in a half hour overtime. The half hour overtime increased my gross pay by $19.66. Amazingly, this resulted in my federal income tax increasing by $20.13. In effect, I paid (the Prime Minister) 47 cents for the privilege of working a half hour overtime.\n\nThis is so incredible that one would think I am making it up. My friend can come over and examine the pay stub. He is so embarrassed his face is red with rage. I do not blame him. I would be embarrassed if I was a Liberal as well.\n\nThe letter goes on to say:\n\nI recognize that this is an anomaly caused by steps in the tax tables, but the very fact that a step could result in an apparent marginal tax rate of 102% tells me that our tax rates are too high. As a resident of British Columbia with a good salary, my actual marginal tax rate is well over 50% and the pay stub is included.\n\nI would be happy to table these letters in the House if my friend would like. I will voluntarily table them for my friend and he can have a look at them and explore them all he wants. I offer these to the Clerk.",

            "text": "Well, I am here, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that is okay.\n\nSuffice to say that members across the way are profoundly embarrassed by their record of taxation and they should be. Do members know why? It is because people on the Liberal side of the House spend hours, days, weeks professing how much they care. They care so much. They care about the poor, the downtrodden and the middle class. My goodness, if words of concern were dollar bills, we would be millionaires. We hear it every day from that side of the House. We saw it in the throne speech. Oh, they care so much, but when it comes down to action, my God, they tax the hide off people. We see it every day. We get these kinds of letters every day.\n\nBecause of bracket creep, on January 1, 85,000 low income Canadians, who have never paid taxes in their life, will be dragged onto the tax rolls for the first time. They will start paying taxes. Six billion dollars a year is what this government takes from Canadians who have incomes of less than $20,000 a year. That is shameful. It is shocking.\n\nThe Liberals should be embarrassed, especially when they get up and rant and rave about social justice and concern for the little guy. No one should believe it. Those are empty words that we hear over and over again from the people on the other side.\n\nThere is a better way of approaching this. The very first thing that needs to be done is for them to quit pretending they care about cutting taxes. They should admit that they have no intention of cutting taxes in a substantial way and that they will continue to spend because Liberals are tax and spend. It seems to be something genetic.\n\nWhat we ultimately want to see in Canada is a government that is committed to cutting taxes, paying down debt and holding the line on spending. We are already spending more than we have ever spent before. We believe that is the real way to help people.\n\nI will say a few words about how to help some of the people who my friends across the way say they care so much about. How do we help people who do not have skills and who really are people who suffered over the last many years? The most obvious way is to create so many jobs that we have three jobs chasing every person instead of the other way around.\n\nIt is time to get this economy roaring so that we regain the heritage that is ours, although unrealized over the last generation. It is the heritage of an economy that is prospering so much that Canadians can go out, sometimes get jobs without many skills and be trained on the job.\n\nMy friend from Provencher can heckle all he wants. He can heckle and make fun of people on the low end of the income scale, but that is wrong.\n\nWhat we are looking for is an economy that booms to the point where if people do not have skills or perhaps have not finished school, they can get a job and learn those skills on the job.\n\nOne of the most amazing examples of how that can happen is what has happened in the boom in the United States in the last little while. The United States has an unemployment rate of around 4.1%. Our rate is about 75% higher and 75% higher than our historical average. We used to have an unemployment rate that was lower than the United States.\n\nWhat is happening now in the United States is that many people, the ones who were often the last to benefit when something was going well in the economy, are benefiting in a tremendous way. The bottom 20% of the black community in the United States, in terms of income, has traditionally been a group that was left out whenever there was any kind of increase in prosperity. There is no question that they were a downtrodden group. Since the economy in the U.S. has taken off, because it has been unfettered to a big degree by the regulations and taxes that we still bear, the bottom 20% of that group has an unemployment rate of 6.9%, the same unemployment rate that we have in Canada. These are the poorest of the poor in the United States. These people, who often have little skills, are now getting jobs, experience, contacts and are regaining pride. In many cases, they have had to rely on welfare in the past, but that is no longer the case. They now have real hope.\n\nWhy are we denying that to people in Canada? There are many places in this country where unemployment is through the roof. Everyone is in the same boat in places like Newfoundland, Cape Breton, parts of Quebec, the northern regions, the inner cities and in parts of every province. We see it all over the place in Canada. Why are we denying those opportunities to people who need it most in Canada? We can do it here as well. We do not have to be second cousins when it comes to economic prosperity. We used to be the economic betters of the United States. We have it within us to do that again.\n\nWhy do we accept this malaise that we see coming from the Liberal government, this mediocre approach to everything? Why not cut taxes? Why not get the economy booming again and put people back to work in droves? Why not do that? Mike Harris does it in Ontario. They do it in Alberta. Why will the Liberal government not do it?\n\nWe have an obligation as legislators in the country to do what is right for Canadians. We are failing in that job. The Liberal government has let people down. I members across the way will not do it for themselves then they should do it for their children and grandchildren. We have a moral obligation to leave the country better than we found it.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this last debate on the prebudget consultations that have been going on since the beginning of this session.\n\nFrom the outset, I would like to thank the thousands of Quebecers who, in September and October, contributed to one of the largest democratic exercises undertaken by the Bloc Quebecois, over the past two years now, which was meeting Quebecers to ask for their opinions on the federal government's budget.\n\nThis year in particular, we asked those whom we met all over Quebec the following question: How should the Minister of Finance use the huge surpluses that he generated at the expense of the unemployed, the sick, the students, the provinces and everyone, except itself?\n\nI am also taking this opportunity to thank my leader, the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, for giving us the opportunity to meet our constituents and for having established a practice which, we hope, will continue in the future. Finally, I would like to thank my Bloc Quebecois colleagues for agreeing to take part in this excellent exercise and for making a brilliant presentation of the conclusions of these consultations.\n\nThese conclusions were collected in a synthesis report presented by the Bloc Quebecois, through its leader and its finance critic as well as the hon. member for Lévis, who took the opportunity to promote a shipbuilding policy. I just wanted to point this out to my fellow Quebecers that we delivered the goods by tabling about three weeks ago on their behalf a document that includes the consensus reached and their main priorities.\n\nFirst of all, I want to go over the Minister of Finance's estimates concerning the surpluses for the years to come. With this minister, we have gotten used to the way he fiddles with the real budget figures and his forecasts, first with regard to the deficit and then with regard to the surplus. He has made us very conservative, because his forecasts are very conservative, but he has shown us in the past that he can be incredibly secretive.\n\nOften, he has even juggled the figures to prepare an extremely summary and fragmented table regarding the options available to the federal government in order to fight the poverty to which he himself has contributed since 1994 by drastically cutting our social programs and to support economic growth and job creation.\n\nWhen the Minister of Finance tells us in his economic update that he expects a $95 billion surplus to be accumulated in the next five years, the truth must be even more amazing. For this year alone, the minister expects a $5 billion surplus. When he comes up with these sorts of things, he shows little respect for the public.\n\nThe federal government's surplus for the first eight months of the current fiscal year is already $8 billion, that is $3 billion over the minister's forecast surplus for the whole of this year. We can expect that the surplus will easily top $12 billion this year. This is more then twice what the minister had forecast.\n\nThat gives the government considerable leeway. As a matter of fact, we did not wait. In September and October of this year, we made our own projections regarding the current surplus, next year's surplus and the leeway that could develop as a result and be used to improve the Canadian economy and social programs.\n\nWe believe that, with part of this year's surplus and with next year's surplus, which we think will reach $15 billion, and with a tax reform, which would not take ten years but a few months to achieve, the minister could have $25 billion to play with in the next fiscal year.\n\nWe have consulted the people regarding this possibility. Everywhere in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois, through its members who work hard to defend Quebec's interests, has consulted Quebecers regarding these projections and the use of that money.\n\nHere are the main things on which people agree with regard to the use of this enormous amount of leeway the federal government has over the next year.\n\nFirst, Quebecers have always believed—and they still do, as shown in the latest survey—it is essential that the Minister of Finance restore transfer payments to the provinces for health, higher education and income security.\n\nSecond, it is important to return to a true employment insurance plan, one that really helps the unemployed. There is almost complete unanimity that the EI plan has to be revamped, because it no longer covers all the people it should.\n\nThird, we were hoping that there would be promising projects for the financial and social economy. We are thinking in particular of a real shipbuilding policy for Canada, which does not exist at the present time, the construction of social housing, and infrastructure programs, including highways.\n\nFourth, we called for a real tax cut for low and middle income Canadians and Quebecers, not just window-dressing, but lasting tax reform that would permanently end the injustices that have hit middle income families particularly hard in recent years.\n\nI will go through these four points, one by one, comparing them with what the Liberal majority is proposing in its report.\n\nFirst, there is the issue of social transfers. As I mentioned, the consensus is clear that this is top on the priority list. Quebecers want the CHST restored. It will take $3.7 billion annually, starting next fiscal, to return to the level of the transfer in 1993-94, before the Minister of Finance slashed the payments that are used to help fund health and education.\n\nYesterday, I listened to the secretary of state say that cuts to provincial social transfer payments were a athing of the past. What hypocrisy, especially from the secretary of state. I hope he has some idea of the figures. If not, his incompetence is shocking.\n\nThe cuts announced by the Minister of Finance in 1994 are ongoing and will continue to apply until 2003. Up until now, the cumulative drastic cuts to education, health and income security total $21.4 billion. By the year 2003, since the cuts are ongoing and despite the fact that parts of the cuts were cancelled, federal transfers to the provinces for health care, education and income security will have been reduced by more than $30 billion.\n\nThis is not a thing of the past. The cuts are still being made, but in an underhanded way. As members know, we have gotten used to the Minister of Finance's vile hypocrisy. He makes one announcement only, but the cuts he announces are good for seven or eight years, and he does not have to repeat them year after year.\n\nWhat is so revolting is that, because of the drastic cuts made by our Minister of Finance, a shipowner and a millionaire, Quebec is out by $6.3 billion to pay for health care, higher education and income security.\n\nIt comes to $860 per Quebecer and 37% of all the cuts made in Canada. The Quebec population accounts for 24.5% of the Canadian population, but the Government of Quebec was hit by 37% of the cuts to the Canada health and social transfer.\n\nNo wonder our health sector is having problems. Although these problems occur throughout the country, they hurt us a lot more. And the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said it before: Quebec has to hurt. Well, the government is certainly on the right track, particularly with its bill preventing Quebec from using the democratic process freely in a referendum. If Quebec has to hurt, the government is definitely on the right track.\n\nThis year alone, the Government of Quebec will have $1.7 billion less for health, post-secondary education and welfare. Based on the historic distribution before 1994, before the federal government's contributions in those three sectors were consolidated into a single transfer called the Canada social transfer, here is what it looks like.\n\nThis year, the Government of Quebec will be short $875 million in federal transfers for health. Do members know what such an amount of money represents? It represents 3,000 jobs for physicians. It represents 5,000 jobs for nurses. It is a lot of money. And then people say that the Government of Quebec really has lots of problems in the area of health. But it is this government that is causing considerable harm to the sick in Quebec and to the finances of the Government of Quebec.\n\nBased on the historic distribution, $500 million of the $1.7 billion would have gone to education. Do members know what we could do if we had $500 million more to put into education in Quebec? We could hire 5,800 university professors. And the cuts are a thing of the past? How hypocritical can one get? In terms of income security, the Government of Quebec is getting $325 million less to fight poverty in Quebec. Do members have any idea what could be done with that money? It would mean an additional $500 for each and every welfare recipient in Quebec.\n\nOf course, $500 a year is not a lot of money for a millionaire like the Minister of Finance, but for those who are having trouble making ends meet, who are struggling, $500 a year is a fortune. And this is what they are being deprived of. Then the government goes around bragging that cuts are a thing of the past, that they have put their fiscal house in order and that they are on the right track. Give me a break.\n\nThe report of the Liberal majority on the finance committee does not recommend that the social transfers to the provinces be restored. It does not say a word about poverty either, but I am going to come back to that issue.\n\nSecond, the report says nothing about reinstating a real employment insurance program. Despite the representations made here and elsewhere in Canada and especially in the province of Quebec where the Bloc carried out wide consultations, the report of the Liberal majority on the finance committee does not mention the need to reform the employment insurance program. It is shocking.\n\nOnly 42% of the unemployed are eligible to benefits, even if 100% of the workers pay premiums. The situation for women is even worse. Only 31% of them are eligible, but all of them do pay premiums. They are going after the men and women who are unemployed, as well as pregnant women. Their benefits are being cut because they have been on precautionary cessation of work under the CSST. Because the days and hours during which they were covered by the CSST are not factored in, they are not eligible to special benefits for pregnant women. This is scandalous.\n\nSo, nothing on EI. The representations made by thousands of Quebecers and Canadians were ignored.\n\nThird, the structuring projects. I mentioned earlier that the budget offers many great possibilities. The Minister of Finance is hiding more surpluses. He is hiding facts about his real leeway. He has much more flexibility than he cares to admit. He has more leeway than he knows what to do with. The liberal majority on the finance committee could have suggested to spend more than $500 million a year on structuring projects, on infrastructure projects. This is ridiculous.\n\nWith the possibilities and flexibility anticipated for next year and the subsequent two, the committee could have suggested $3 billion a year, as we had. In this regard, we had the support of all stakeholders in civil society, including employer associations.\n\nThere is nothing either on structuring projects in support of a real shipbuilding policy for Canada. My Bloc colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has worked very hard for many years to promote such a policy. Canadians from sea to sea want a national shipbuilding policy.\n\nNot long ago, my colleague informed me that he had gained the support of the Canadian Shipowners Association, of which our finance minister is a member. No one is asking him to secure privileges as a shipowner. There is a difference between passing legislation that favours him and his companies, as he did two years ago with Bill C-28, and developing a national shipbuilding policy to help create jobs in Canada and ensure, for instance, that the level of jobs at Lévis shipyards gets back to what it was before, that is 5,000 jobs, if my memory serves me right.",

            "text": "I am told there were three thousand. It is now less than half. What we need is a new shipbuilding policy with economic spinoffs. Not a word from the Liberals on that, though. Everyone agrees there is a need, but the Liberal government is turning a deaf ear.\n\nConcerning social housing, it is a joke, there is nothing in here. It only says that a report is expected from the minister responsible for the homeless, who is still travelling all over the country to hear comments. The government recently announced that $500 million might be made available for community shelters where the homeless could spend the night.\n\nThey earmark a mere $500 million to shelters. They completely ignore the whole issue of social housing and overlook the fact that there is a way of doing things. Opening shelters is one thing, but support must also be provided to help the homeless get out of that situation.\n\nI take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague from Quebec for her excellent analysis on poverty, homelessness and federal government policies. Since 1994, this irresponsible government should have implemented policies and increased its contribution over the years, using the tremendous surplus it generated last year and will be generating in the coming years.\n\nI also want to pay tribute to the members of the Accueil Bonneau choir, who honoured us with a visit on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the anti-poverty motion passed by the House. They gave a wonderful concert. I want to remind members once again that it is because of the admirable work done by my colleague from Quebec and by the Bloc Quebecois in their fight against poverty. While we are fighting poverty, the government is creating poverty. The Liberals create poverty.\n\nWith respect to tax cuts, I notice that the Liberal majority members of the Standing Committee on Finance are the true reflection of their government. These are people who put on a big show, making suggestions that may look spectacular and generous at first glance. At one point, they even got us wondering if an election was not about to be called.\n\nHowever, a closer look reveals a big problem with the tax proposals put forward in the Liberal majority report on taxation. In our consultations, Quebecers told us “Yes, substantial tax cuts are required, but first tax tables and the whole tax structure must be fully indexed”. Since 1985 tax tables and tax structure are no longer indexed.\n\nAs long as this issue remains unsettled there will be no lasting solution to the problem of tax fairness for all. We are not talking here about insignificant amounts. Since 1994 the bracket creep has resulted in extra tax revenues of $17.6 billion for the federal government. It is unfair.\n\nIn the few minutes I have left let me explain what indexation is all about.\n\nLet me put it simply, as we should always do in this kind of demonstration. If a taxpayer earns $100 a week and his employer gives him a $2 raise, his new salary is $102. But in the economy, prices in general have gone up $3, which means that the taxpayer is actually poorer.\n\nAfter a $2 pay raise and a $3 overall price increase, this taxpayer is in fact $1 poorer. Full indexation of the tax tables and the tax structure as a whole takes into consideration the fact that the taxpayer is poorer and not richer, even with an income of $102 compared to $100 the previous year.\n\nSo, this increase in poverty is taken into account and the taxation level is reduced according to the inflation related rise in poverty. This measure was abolished and, since 1974, $17 billion in new taxes have been collected. The government cannot be blamed for doing something to increase taxation, but it can be blamed however for not reforming the tax system and restoring the full indexation that was abolished in 1985.\n\nDo you know what $17 billion represent? It is a lot of money. With $17 billion, one could give around $2,400 to each of the 7 million Quebecers and that would make up for the money that was stolen from them. It represents about twice the education budget for Quebec and one hundred times its environment budget. It is a lot of money.\n\nThe report does not address these issues but it does mention the elimination of the 5% surtax. That measure, along with the elimination of the 3% surtax announced in the last budget, will greatly benefit those who earn $250,000 or more. It will give them $9,300.\n\nHowever, the taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $70,000 will see their taxes reduced by only $200. Even by increasing the ceiling to 15%, this solution will only last until 2001. After 2001, without full indexing, our tax system will become unfair again and taxpayers will continue to pay more taxes than they normally should.\n\nFor all these reasons, we tabled a minority report, a dissenting opinion based on what we heard when we went to meet the people, putting our ideas together with theirs. We gathered different priorities and views and presented them, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and myself, to the Standing Committee on Finance on behalf of Quebecers.",

It reminded me that we are in the House as members of parliament not just to speak for our own communities but to represent all regions of Canada when there is a particular crisis.\n\nThe problems we have had in terms of changing the fiscal direction of the country have not just been difficult for the province of Quebec. I acknowledge that we have problems in my community of downtown Toronto with a lack of affordable shelter. We have had lots of problems, but when we on this side of the House as well as members of the New Democratic Party and members of the Conservative Party stand, we speak for all Canadians.\n\nIt is terribly unfair that the member positions his criticisms of us as a government. By the way, some of those criticisms can be valid because we have had a very tough time with the economy. He should also position them in a way that acknowledges the province of Quebec over the last 10 or 12 years has been classified through the economic formula as a have not province. Those provinces in an advantaged position have transferred over $100 billion. I have never heard any resentment on any side or from any other members of parliament about the fact that those transfers have been made, because that is the nature of a federation. I appeal to the member to consider that the House is the boardroom of Canada. It is not just for us to come here and speak only for those people who are in pain in Quebec.\n\nThe member should start to realize that the special privilege and responsibility of being in here is that it is as much my responsibility to care about his constituents as it is his to care about mine. We have to remind ourselves and Quebecers that they are not a persecuted community or a persecuted province. In fact all Canadians have shared happily with Quebecers over the last number of years, and we will continue to do so long after these separatists are put into extinction.",

If they are not to be found in the Liberal majority report, it is simply because the member and his colleagues did not do their job.

That is the fact of the matter. That money was owing to us and more is still owing.\n\nTo give but one example, the harmonization of the GST with the provincial sales tax in the maritimes. Since the early 1990s, we in Quebec have harmonized the GST and the Quebec sales tax. We should be getting $2 billion for that and they are refusing to hand it over.\n\nAs I have said, the effort we are being asked to make with respect to the cuts has been $2 billion too high ever since 1994.

What scares me is not the money to be invested in that project but rather the way this program will be adapted to the situation in Quebec. It is true that realities differ. We were saying a while ago that there was a shortfall, that Quebec did not get its fair share. In social housing, Quebec never received its fair share. I would like my colleague to tell us if he is worried about the federal government's flexibility.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the minister responsible for the homeless will be judged on the way this money is given to the provinces and on her flexibility with regard to the distribution of the millions of dollars invested for the homeless.

There is no higher calling than public service and no higher place to serve than in the House of Commons.\n\nI begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar who elected me in the byelection on November 15. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to serve them. I will do so with all my energy and to the best of my ability.\n\nI find it humbling to follow in the footsteps of the great parliamentarians who have preceded me in this vast prairie constituency. The list includes honourable social democrats such as M. J. Coldwell, Woodrow Lloyd, Alf Gleave and Chris Axworthy. It includes as well the Right Honourable Ray Hnatyshyn, a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister who later became our governor general.\n\nMr. Coldwell represented this riding in parliament from 1935 to 1958. He led the CCF in the 1940s and 1950s. He worked tirelessly to bring about many of the great social advances that have shaped our country. These include hospital and auto insurance, pensions, family allowances, labour and welfare reforms.\n\nWoodrow Lloyd served Biggar in the Saskatchewan legislature for 20 years, from 1944 to 1964. In 1961 he succeeded Tommy Douglas as premier. With great patience and great courage, Mr. Lloyd prevailed over the tumultuous strike by Saskatchewan's doctors the following year. Our cherished national medicare system is at least in part Mr. Lloyd's gift to Canada.\n\nM. J. Coldwell had an abiding commitment to social justice. Woodrow Lloyd had a clear and ringing view of social democratic philosophy. “Ours is not just a gimme or a gouge the rich philosophy,” Woodrow Lloyd said. “It matches claims with obligations, imposing on each of us a greater individual responsibility than is imposed by other political parties”.\n\nI am also guided by the legacy of Alf Gleave who represented the Saskatoon-Biggar area in parliament from 1968 to 1974, and who earlier was one of the pioneers of medicare. When Alf died last summer, journalist Barry Wilson in his eulogy quoted Alf's own words, summing up his life as a family man, a farmer and an elected representative. “At the beginning of the century,” Alf wrote, “the people who came to the prairies and those who followed them, the next generation such as myself, made a more secure and bountiful life here by working together, by sharing the load”.\n\nThis need to balance claims and obligations, to work together and to share the load has never been more relevant than it is today, as the 20th century comes to an end and a new century and a new millennium are about to dawn.\n\nNowhere is this need to work together more evident today than in the farm crisis that now engulfs western Canada, a crisis that tears at the heart of so many of the families I represent in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. What my NDP colleagues have said so often in the House is tragically true. That is that western farmers are gripped by the worst crisis since the 1930s, and in some respects, a crisis that is greater than that of the great depression.\n\nThe pain and misery are unprecedented economically and emotionally. Farm stress has reached epidemic proportions. Families are disintegrating. Bankruptcy is driving people from their homes and from their way of life.\n\nAn astonishing 46% of western farmers are now seriously considering leaving the land. What this means, should it come to pass, is a mass exodus of as many as 16,000 farmers across Saskatchewan and Manitoba within the next short period of time. The impact of this calamity would be unimaginable.\n\nWhy is this crisis occurring? It is happening because our national government, in its cult-like adherence to the ideology of free trade, has cut support for grain farmers by 60% over the last eight years. The government has accepted the free market mantra of the Business Council on National Issues and embraced the global gospel of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe Liberal government has played a destructive game giving away much more in trade negotiations than it has gained in return. Western farmers have been ambushed on the free market road. Consider that European farmers receive 56 cents in support for each dollar of wheat that is sold. American farmers get 38 cents. Canadian farmers today get a paltry 9 cents.\n\nThis is happening at a time of unprecedented federal wealth. Our government, as we have heard here today, is projecting almost $100 billion in surpluses over the next five years. If he wanted to, the Prime Minister could deal with the farm crisis and he would scarcely notice the amount of money that it would take. But he refuses. He is caught like a deer in the headlights on the free market road.\n\nI join with my NDP colleagues in pleading for a change of heart. I urge the Prime Minister to return at least $1 billion of the money that his government has scooped out of the Saskatchewan economy in recent years. This is just 1% of his forecasted five year surpluses. Farmers need help desperately and they need it now.\n\nThis is an immediate measure. In the medium term the government must re-examine the AIDA program to see if it can be fixed. In the longer term, a combination of supports and cost cutting measures and diversification will have to be adopted if western agriculture is going to survive.\n\nUnfortunately the deafening silence of the government in response to the plea of farmers also extends in many cases to society as a whole. We see this only too clearly in the majority report of the Standing Committee on Finance with its empty rationale recommending $46 billion in tax cuts for mainly high income earners over the next few years. This is wrong as my colleague the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle pointed out in his minority report.\n\nThe finance committee report continues the bogus philosophy of trickle down economics preached for the last 20 years by leaders such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and Brian Mulroney. This dreary message is always the same. It goes something like this: give the horse enough oats and the sparrows will eventually be fed. This has never been true and we will only make matters worse if we repeat the same mistakes again and again.\n\nTax cuts that benefit mainly the rich will widen the unacceptable gap that already exists between the wealthy and the poor in our society. This gap has gone from embarrassing to offensive to downright obscene.\n\nNew Democrats advocate a fair and sane approach, one that will work, if only the government will adopt it and implement it. We believe that the surpluses projected over the next few years give Canadians a rare opportunity to return to the philosophy of redistributing income to those who need it most. We can undo the damage that successive waves of government cutbacks have inflicted on families, on public services and on living standards in the 1990s.\n\nThere is only one real test of any economy that matters and that is, does it serve its people? New Democrats believe that the debate over surpluses must focus on improving the quality of life for all Canadians. We can deal with the farm crisis, child poverty and homelessness. We can give our children the best possible start in life. We can preserve public health and expand it to home care and pharmacare as the Liberals had promised to do in 1993. We can foster world class education and training. We can invest in roads and public transit. We can provide tax relief by making an initial 1% cut in the GST. We can, as Canada's churches have asked, have our country forgive the debt owing to us by some of the world's poorest countries.\n\nI commit myself, as my social democratic predecessors have done before me, to work tirelessly to achieve these just and time honoured goals. I will not rest and my predecessors will not rest in peace until we have built Jerusalem in this green and pleasant land.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar on his maiden speech in the House of Commons. He follows in the great tradition of prairie social democrats such M. J. Coldwell, the second leader of the CCF in Canada; Alf Gleave, a former national president of the Farmers Union and member of the House of Commons for six years; and the honourable Chris Axworthy, attorney general and justice minister of the province of Saskatchewan, his immediate predecessor. I welcome him to the House of Commons.\n\nI was quite struck by the majority report of the finance committee. I see my Liberal friends are probably even astonishing you, Mr. Speaker, because they are recommending that $46 billion or about half of the $95 billion surplus should go to tax cuts.\n\nMy good red Tory friend from Nova Scotia talked about hypocrisy tax in the red book promises. Perhaps that is why you are in the chair today, Mr. Speaker, because you can remain neutral on the breaking of a great Liberal principle of balance. Half of it was to go into program spending and half into deficit reduction and tax cuts. Now, afraid of the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party has become a very right wing Conservative Party and is advocating putting half the surplus into tax cuts primarily for wealthy people.\n\nWho in the country has paid for the fight on the debt and the deficit? Is it the Conrad Blacks of the world? Is it the wealthy people of the world? Is it the wealthier banks or the big firms in Canada? No. It is the ordinary people of the country who have paid for the fight on the deficit through cutbacks in health care, through cutbacks in education, through cutbacks in our social programs, and through cutbacks imposed on farmers. That is who has paid for the fight on the deficit. That is who has paid for the debt. Now that we have a surplus it seems to me the people who paid the price should reap the reward of a fiscal surplus, the ordinary people of Canada.\n\nThe Liberal Party is afraid of the Reform Party and the Leader of the Opposition and the tax cut agenda. I see across the way the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke who is shaking in his chair in fear of the Reform Party. It is the same with the Minister of Finance who is implementing the Reform Party policy in terms of massive cutbacks in social programs like we never saw from any Conservative Party in the history of Canada including Brian Mulroney's.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened and there is no better example of that than the 60% cutback in support to farmers by the Liberal government across the way when their competitors in Europe and the United States have not been cutting back but indeed have been increasing support and subsidies to their farmers.\n\nAs the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar said, 56 cents of a dollar in Europe will come from the treasury in Brussels and in the United States 38 cents will come from the treasury in Washington to support farmers. What is it in our country? It is 9 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe Reform Party has called for the end of all farm subsidies. Now it is the Liberal Party that is implementing the Reform policy to get rid of subsidies and support prices for our farmers. Farmers are leaving the land. Farmers are going bankrupt. We have heard time and time again that on the prairies we need $1.3 billion of immediate aid, a trade equalization payment to farmers to allow them to survive which would not even bring us up to the American levels or the European levels. What has the Liberal Party done? This message has fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWe had in parliament in Ottawa a few weeks ago the premiers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, supported by all three political parties in Manitoba, three political parties in Saskatchewan, the farm organizations, the chambers of commerce and the trade unions, with a joint position of solidarity in support of $1.3 billion for farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. What did the Liberal government say? It said nothing in terms of extra assistance to farmers. No wonder the Liberals are hanging their heads in shame.\n\nThere was a throne speech back in October. I looked at it very carefully and there was absolutely nothing in it, not even a reference to the farm crisis. Where do these people live? They do not know the real poor people who are facing problems.\n\nThen a month later we got this media show by the Minister of Finance. He flew to London, Ontario, to make a media statement. Again many of the Liberal members are wondering why all this money was spent for him to fly to London. A big schedule was worked out for the Minister of Finance and he made a statement on national television. In a 45 minute speech there was not one reference to the farm crisis despite the suffering, the pain, the demonstrations, the protests, the writings and the calls by the united front across Saskatchewan and Manitoba for extra assistance.\n\nThe Minister of Finance and the parliamentary committee on finance are more Conservative than anything I saw with Brian Mulroney or Conservative governments in the past. It is not just the farm crisis. Let us look at what they have done to health care. It is enough to tear our hair out. We have had the biggest cutbacks in health care in the history of the country. The cutback in federal funding to the provinces for health care is causing problems today in hospitals and emergency rooms from one part of the country to another. The closings of hospitals and the lineups for surgery are because of the cutbacks by the Minister of Finance.\n\nWhy is there silence on the backbench? The minister from the Northwest Territories never gets up to defend health care. I have never seen her get up to say that the Minister of Finance should put more money into health care. She should be ashamed of herself. She represents ordinary people and knows that people are in lineups because of cutbacks in health care by the federal government.\n\nWe have the farm crisis and the health care problem. Where are the recommendations in this report for money for health care? We have a $100 billion surplus, and what has been recommended for health care? Nothing. Even the Canadian Medical Association is saying that we need an extra $1.5 billion per year in health care.",

I was saying that the member across the way like other Liberal members is not rising in the House of Commons and calling on the Minister of Finance to put more money into health care. The record speaks for itself.\n\nThe Liberal Party is implementing policies of the Leader of the Opposition and the Reform Party which call for massive cutbacks and a reduction of the role of government. That is exactly what it is doing. They are setting the agenda and that party across the way has implemented that agenda and knows it. That is why its members are so sensitive.\n\nIt is not just health care and the farm crisis. Let us look at what happened in terms of the cutbacks to education. The government is not investing in education like it should be. That is why we are falling behind in public support of education almost every state in United States. That is what is happening in Canada. If we had more federal moneys going to the provinces for education we would have better training for our people. We would have a more competitive and productive economy. That is not happening because of the cutbacks and the priorities of the government across the way.\n\nThe important point about the finance committee report is that it is supposed to be a framework and a vision for the next five years. What will the government do? It will continue the same right wing reactionary policies of the Reform Party in terms of handing out more and more money to wealthy people. In fact, the member for Calgary Southwest said at one time in the House that Conrad Black deserved a tax cut. The Reform Party is not implementing it but it is the Liberal Party across the way.\n\nThis is why we need a public debate in the country about our real priorities. The priorities should be to invest in people, to create more equality in people, to invest in the health care system, to come to the assistance of prairie farmers and to invest in the education system. Those should be our priorities and they are not the priorities today.\n\nWe hear all this stuff about tax cuts. I remember the Liberals in opposition, Mr. Speaker, and so do you. The member from the Northwest Territories was there. I remember when Brian Mulroney brought in the GST. I remember the Liberal Party saying in the House that if Canadians elected the Liberal Party, and it is in the red book, it would abolish the GST. Does everyone remember that?\n\nThe only member who had some honour in that regard was the former Deputy Prime Minister who resigned her seat and went to her people in a byelection. The Liberals made that promise on the GST. They promised to get rid of NAFTA, the free trade agreement. They promised many other things that were in the red book, and they broke those promises.\n\nWith that, Mr. Speaker, I hope you agree with me that what we are seeing is a right wing agenda by the Minister of Finance implementing the policies of the Reform Party of Canada.",

This is in sync with the policy being put forward by the Reform Party.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, who is not a member of the Reform Party, made the worst cuts ever to health care, at the national level.\n\nI remember very well when the national health program was introduced under Mr. Pearson. The CCF with Woodrow Lloyd and Tommy Douglas, from my province of Saskatchewan, were the first ones to come up with the idea. It was created at the national level by Mr. Pearson, a true Liberal. A true small “l” liberal, not a capital “L” Liberal like the ones we have today. At the time, the provinces and the federal government came to an agreement whereby the federal government would pay one half of the costs of the national health program, and the provinces, the other half.\n\nWhere do we stand today? The federal government only pays 12% or 13% of the costs. There is no national unity. Our country has no great vision. Where are the old Liberals? Where is the old Liberal Party of Pierre Trudeau, of Mr. Pearson, of Laurier and King? Where is that Liberal Party?\n\nThat Liberal Party has vanished completely. There is not a lot of difference now between the Liberal Party and the Mr. Manning's Reform Party. They are just about the same. We are stuck here with a government that is more conservative than Brian Mulroney's government was. Brian Mulroney never did such a thing.

There are 14 days left in this century, a century that was to have belonged to Canada. It is important at this time that we reflect on what is occurring not just within our borders but around the world.\n\nThe rate of global change facing Canadians is unprecedented. The challenges facing Canadians and the potential opportunities available to Canadians have never been greater. How are we doing in this environment? The Liberals say that the fundamentals are strong. The ex-patriot Canadian economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said that one should beware of governments who claim that the fundamentals are strong. That is an important bit of advice to heed at this time.\n\nIn this new globally competitive, interconnected environment the fundamentals are not simply esoteric statistics or unimportant numbers. These are not distant trivia that we can afford to ignore. We cannot afford to ignore what other countries are doing to create environments for economic growth.\n\nLet us look at those fundamentals the government boasts about. We have an unemployment rate that is 70% higher than that of the U.S. We have the highest personal income tax rates of any country in the G-7. We have the second highest corporate tax rates in the OECD, of those 31 countries. Last year we were third highest but we are now second highest. Germany, a social democratic country of the same brethren as the New Democratic Party in this country, saw fit to reduce its corporate tax burden and create federal levels of economic growth and opportunity in Germany.\n\nFor the first time in the history of our country, our level of personal debt on average in Canada is $43,200. For the first time that is surpassing the average disposable income of Canadians. In fact, we have the fastest growing levels of personal debt of any country in the G-7. While the government boasts about being in the black, Canadians are in the red to a greater extent than they have ever been in the past.\n\nPersonal disposable income in Canada has dropped by 8% since 1990. During the same period of time Americans have enjoyed a 10% increase. There has been a widening of the gap by about 10% in terms of personal disposable income between ourselves and our neighbours to the south.\n\nThe fastest growing economic engine is in the U.S. We have an opportunity being a country that borders the U.S. to benefit from that growth, but not if we continually focus on the policies of the past and ignore the opportunities to build policies based on the realities of the future.\n\nLet us look at some other fundamental areas. Productivity growth rates in Canada have been lagging behind those of the U.S. In Canada the equities markets on the Toronto Stock Exchange have had a relatively anemic growth compared to the robust growth in the U.S. During the same period of time the TSE was required to grow by 100%, the Dow Jones Index in New York grew by 300%. As Americans are getting richer, Canadians are getting poorer.\n\nUnder this government since 1993 there has been a 10 cent drop in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The Prime Minister's response was typically erudite, that it would be good for tourism. The logical corollary of his argument would be that if we were to reduce the dollar to zero, we could become the greatest exporting nation in the world. That logic simply does not work. Most Canadians realize it is impossible to devalue our way to prosperity.\n\nThe brain drain issue is a very important fundamental. It involves the choices being made by some of the best and brightest young people in Canada. According to the report by the Conference Board of Canada last summer, the number of people leaving Canada and seeking opportunities in the U.S. has grown from 16,000 people per year a few years ago to 96,000 people per year.\n\nWe see a very disturbing trend, the devouring of corporate Canada. At the end of the 20th century, which was a century that was supposed to belong to Canada, it is important to pause and think about some of these things. It is sad that at the end of the 20th century Canada no longer really belongs to us. That is largely due to the fact that the government fails to accept some of the market driven realities of a globally competitive environment.\n\nI will give the House an idea of the impact of the devouring of corporate Canada. Back in 1994 the value of U.S. acquisitions of Canadian companies was $5.6 billion. In 1998 the Canadian corporate value purchased by Americans had grown to $16.1 billion. This year it is $25.6 billion. That is no accident. It has a lot to do with the reduction in the value of the Canadian dollar.\n\nLet us look at some of the causes of the reduction in the Canadian dollar, that 10 cent precipitous drop and decline in the take home pay of Canadians since 1993. A lot of that has to do with tax issues.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 1980s Canada was able to maintain approximately the same level of economic growth as the U.S. During the same period of time we had a positive yield in that our interest rates were marginally higher than those of the U.S. yet we were able to maintain that similar level of economic growth and prosperity.\n\nHowever in the 1990s and particularly since the election of this government, we have seen a gap between the currency values of the two countries and for the first time in a long time Canada has a negative yield. We have lower interest rates in Canada. We are using monetary policy to compensate for some of the weak fiscal policies of this country.\n\nPart of the reason the Bank of Canada needs to do that is that for the first time ever as a percentage of GDP in Canada, we are at 38% of our GDP in taxes. Compare that to the U.S. which is at 28% of GDP in tax revenues. It is not sustainable. Effectively we are heading toward a government that simply will not be able to continue the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada will not be able to continually use that mechanism. We need strong fiscal mechanisms and levers to be implemented now.\n\nSome of the victims of this devouring of corporate Canada include the Canadian icon MacMillan Bloedel, Poco Petroleums Limited, MetroNet Communications, JDS Fitel, Club Monaco, Noma Industries, Newcourt Credit, Midland Walwyn, Peoples Jewellers and Shoppers Drug Mart. Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada's drug store, is now owned by KKR, Kohlbert Kravis and Roberts out of New York. This is not a good trend for Canada.\n\nIt is very easy for us to do what the Liberals typically do in this kind of situation and that is to try to demonize America, to try to demonize the free market system and to try to somehow create a bogeyman in the people who are logically taking advantage of the situation that exists here. The fact is that in a globally competitive environment, the responsibilities lie with each government to create the levels of economic growth and opportunity for their companies and individuals to succeed and compete globally.\n\nIn that kind of environment the government is clearly failing. It is exposing the nape of Canadian investors, Canadian business people and Canadian individuals to the ferocity of global competition without providing the economic growth levers and productivity enhancement initiatives that they need.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the previous government that had the courage and vision to implement a free trade agreement that this government has embraced and accepted as being good policy in retrospect. The previous government not only had the courage to eliminate the manufacturers' sales tax which was impeding growth and impeding the ability for Canadian enterprises to compete and succeed globally and replace it with the GST, it also deregulated financial services, transportation and energy. All of these are policies that this government embraces. All of them are policies that have been credited by economists as having been largely responsible for the ability for this government to eliminate the deficit.\n\nIf we look at what the achievements of the government have been, the only thing the finance minister can point to is the elimination of the deficit. If we accept, as most economists accept, that the elimination of the deficit was largely due to the structural changes made to the Canadian economy by the previous government—",

Many of them paid the ultimate price, fighting for the causes of freedom, international peace and human dignity.\n\nIn many senses the training plan laid the foundation of our longstanding co-operation with our allies on the European continent and elsewhere around the world.\n\nToday the tradition of training the world's best aviators lives on with the government's commitment to the innovative NATO flying training in Canada program.",

Ministers and backbenchers are pitching ideas at every chance, all to save an industry that was once at the core of our Canadian identity but is now dominated by Americans and Europeans.\n\nWhat issue is that? Is it agriculture or the farm crisis? No. It is professional hockey and the campaign to cut even further the taxes for millionaire hockey players and team owners. For shame.\n\nThousands of farmers cannot afford to farm any more, but the Liberal budget gave Canadian NHL players an average of $16,000 in tax cuts this year alone. By providing entertainment expense write-offs to buyers of corporate box seats and season tickets, we already subsidize pro-hockey teams heavily from the federal treasury.\n\nThe country has other priorities, like desperate farmers, medicare, the homeless, the unemployed and amateur sport.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I now conclude my remarks after question period.\n\nToday's Globe and Mail editorial was very insightful. It was entitled “The Surprising Legacy of the Minister of Finance”. It describes the elimination of the deficit as the single accomplishment of the Minister of Finance.\n\nIt says specifically that the finance minister's triumph on the deficit is shadowed by wrongheaded policies elsewhere. Of course, we have already established, as the Economist magazine reported, that the credit for deficit reduction in Canada belongs largely to the structural reforms made by the previous government. Therefore, the finance minister cannot really claim that one-hit wonder because he did not really author that one success. Although the finance minister would like to claim being a one-hit wonder, he cannot claim even that to his credit.\n\nLet us look at some of the policies he has implemented. While it is terrible for Liberals to shamelessly take Conservative policies, to implement those policies and then to take credit for the impact of those policies, what would be even worse would be Liberals implementing their own policies. That is what I am concerned about, because we are starting to see a few of those policies rear their ugly heads.\n\nA year ago, the finance made his no decision on the bank mergers. What has been the impact of that decision? I described earlier the complexities and challenges of the increasingly interconnected, globally competitive environment. In that environment, since the minister's decision, Canadian banks have lost about $9 billion of shareholders' value. During the same period, American banks have increased in value by about 10%. Again, as Americans are getting richer, Canadians are getting poorer.\n\nIn making his short-sighted decision on the bank mergers, and refusing to stand up to the banks to defend the long term interests of Canadians by negotiating a better deal on behalf of Canadians in exchange for mergers on issues like jobs, services to rural communities and those types of things, and in unilaterally and arbitrarily saying no, the minister has effectively put his own short term political interests and those of his leadership aspirations ahead of the interests of the 7.5 million Canadians who own bank shares.\n\nYes, 7.5 million Canadians, directly or indirectly, own bank shares and are depending on the returns of those shares for their retirement funds. Again, that was the minister's decision on those issues.\n\nThe minister has failed to address some of the major crises facing Canada right now and the need for significant and broadbased tax reform and tax reduction. On the personal side, we need significant levels of tax reform. On the corporate side, we have, as I mentioned earlier, the second highest corporate tax rates of the 31 countries in the OECD. Last year Germany had the second highest and we had the third. Germany now has the third highest because it has reduced its corporate tax burden. This country continues to cling to the notion that we can tax to death our companies and our individuals and yet still enjoy some level of economic growth.\n\nIn this current environment, we should be undertaking significant levels of tax reform. We should be taking the same courage and vision in our approach to policies that the previous government took with policies, such as free trade, GST and deregulation. In our dissenting report, we discussed the need for broadbased and forward thinking tax reform both on the personal and corporate side.\n\nThe government received an excellent report on corporate taxation by the Mintz commission. It addressed many of the significant flaws in our corporate tax system. If implemented, it would address the distortionary nature of our corporate tax system, the profit and sensitive taxes that currently create significant distortions and damage productivity in Canada.\n\nThe Mintz report also identified the need to bring our corporate tax regime more in line with those of other countries. At a time when other countries are using corporate tax reform and personal tax reform as vehicles and levers for economic growth, including Ireland and the Scandinavian countries, this country continues to cling to the past.\n\nIn our minority report, we identified that tax brackets should be re-indexed. In fact, there is a consensus both on the left and the right that we should be returning to full indexation of the tax brackets. The Fraser Institute agrees with the Caledon Institute in this case. The de-indexation of tax brackets took place during a time of deficit financing in a very difficult fiscal period. In a post-deficit time now more than ever, we need to revisit and eliminate bracket creep which has unfortunately brought more Canadians onto the tax rolls than we have ever had before and we need to revisit that, eliminate bracket creep and re-index tax brackets.\n\nWe need to lower the capital gains tax rates. I was pleased to see that the finance committee report did address this to a certain extent. We would go further. We would reduce the capital gains inclusion rate to 50% from the current 75%. The fact is that we could reduce our personal capital gains tax rates to be equivalent with those of the U.S. It would cost about $240 million per year. For the dramatic unlocking of capital that would occur and for the economic growth that would ensue with that type of visionary policy, $240 million per year is a small price to pay.\n\nUnfortunately, public policy, in particular for the Liberal government, is focused more often on perception rather than reality. There is a stubborn intransigence in areas of capital gains tax and corporate tax reform. That is why the government has shelved the Mintz report and ignored many of its recommendations.\n\nWe would like to see the government set and keep firm debt reduction targets. This is very important. Our country is now in a worse debt to GDP ratio situation than those countries of the EU. We would not qualify under the Maastricht treaty to participate in the common currency of Europe. This is comparing Canada with bastions of fiscal fortitude like France. It is not exactly a positive indicator that we have not been able to maintain the same or lower debt to GDP ratios than our cousins in Europe.\n\nWe would suggest that the foreign content limit be increased to 50% immediately, and ultimately be eliminated once we have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of it. The finance committee is recommending some level of incremental increase over a period of time.\n\nI would argue that at this stage, with the dramatic infusion of capital into the Canadian equity markets, with the Canada pension plan funds and the superannuation funds that we are going to be seeing, there has never been a better time than now to end this economic imprisonment that forces Canadians to accept lower returns, which have cost about $32,000 to the average RRSP over time.\n\nDuring a time when the Dow Jones has appreciated 300%, the TSC has performed in many ways anemically, gaining about 100%. I referred to it earlier as fiscal or economic imprisonment. I think it is very important, in particular while the government clings to the types of tax and regulatory policies that will pummel initiatives in Canada, that it release Canadians and allow them an opportunity to invest some of their hard earned dollars to ensure that they can enjoy a relatively good quality of life in the future.\n\nWe would suggest that the government take very seriously the call for a national highway program and that it increase the proportion of gas taxes that are currently returned to the provinces for highway spending from the current 5%, which is the lowest of any industrialized country, to about 15%.\n\nThis is an area of utmost importance. While there is some need for new spending in some of the traditional areas such as health care, and the farm crisis and the highway system need to be addressed, the government should not engage in new spending programs, including the child care initiative in which some Liberal backbenchers want to engage.\n\nAt a time like this in Canada, when we have never faced more fierce global competitiveness issues, we need to take time to step back and evaluate what is happening in other countries. Other countries are dramatically using innovative tax policies to create levels of economic growth. Other countries are reducing and maintaining lower levels of government spending and lower levels of debt to create the economic environment that will ensure growth.\n\nOther countries are taking on regulatory burden. One of our suggestions is that we have a regulatory budget to allow elected members of the House to debate the merits of individual pieces of regulation so that we do not see a continued growth of regulation by stealth.\n\nThis is my last speech of this millennium in the House. I would hope in the future, in the next millennium, that we would take more seriously the competitiveness issues facing Canadians and that we would actually lead the global environment to create a better environment, instead of simply following and playing catch-up, as the government seems want to do at this time.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Medicine Hat, my friend and colleague on the finance committee, for his question.\n\nEmployment insurance benefits, particularly those relating to seasonal workers, is a very important issue. The Liberals slashed these benefits after 1995. That created a situation which I do not think even the government expected, and the law of unintended consequences kicked in.\n\nIn many cases the slashing of those EI benefits resulted in people who worked seasonally going on provincial social assistance rolls and not working at all. I would assume that the hon. member would agree with me that that created a greater reduction in productivity and human enrichment than would have existed previously.\n\nThat being the case, my personal views on this would be that we should investigate and revisit the notion of individual EI accounts. There was a study done in the U.K. a couple of years ago. It was reported in the Economist magazine in the fall of 1997. It studied the idea of having individual EI accounts that people would pay into over their lives. Some of the contributions would be taken from those individual accounts to top up those who draw more frequently.\n\nThat type of change would provide an incentive for people to not draw frequently. It would have some of the impact which I believe the Liberals were trying to seek in terms of reducing abuse of the EI system by way of an incentive method, as opposed to purely through a penalty or punishment oriented method that ultimately did not have the effect Liberals wanted.\n\nI am sure the hon. member agrees with me that shifting the burden of social assistance to the provinces certainly did not help in any way, shape or form. In fact it prevented many of these people from participating in the workforce.\n\nIt is a complicated issue. There is not a simple, 12 second answer to that. However, I would enjoy exploring the issue with the hon. member at any time in the future.",

I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Leeds—Grenville.\n\nAs the member for Vancouver Kingsway, I hosted a successful prebudget consultation in my riding. I wanted to hear from British Columbians their concerns and ideas on spending the surplus. Those citizens discussed and shared what they believe the priorities should be for the next fiscal year.\n\nA clear priority which emerged from that discussion was the need for tax cuts. However, tax cuts were not to be at the expense of important social programs such as health, education and poverty.\n\nVancouver also faces the serious challenge of homelessness, and many of my constituents expressed grave concerns about this issue.\n\nI did not only listen to the people in my riding. As a member of the all-party Standing Committee on Finance I was able to hear from and speak with many Canadians from British Columbia, the western provinces and indeed across the country. In this very public consultation process we heard the needs and wishes of many Canadians.\n\nCanadians were very clear about the direction the next budget should take. They want tax cuts and debt reduction. They want infrastructure development and improvement in all provinces. They want homelessness and affordable social housing needs to be addressed. They want the serious shortfall in core funding for universities and colleges to be reversed. Canadians, whether in British Columbia or Newfoundland, know what they want and we listened.\n\nMembers of the committee spent long and careful hours analyzing and discussing what we heard. Our recommendations, based on what we learned from the public consultations and town hall meetings held in many ridings, including Vancouver Kingsway, are found in our committee report which was tabled in the House of Commons only a few days ago.\n\nI would like to take a moment to commend the committee chair and the members of the finance committee for their hard work and dedication over the last few months of the prebudget consultation process. I would also like to thank the hundreds of Canadians, individuals and organizations, who took the time and effort to participate in the prebudget consultation process. All made highly valuable contributions to the shaping of the committee's report and recommendations.\n\nTax reduction is a major part of the committee's recommendations. We are suggesting that personal income tax reform be given a high priority. Reduced personal income taxes would mean that Canadians would keep more of their hard earned dollars to invest and to spend in the economy. We want to see the elimination of the 5% personal surtax. Along similar lines, the child tax credit should be extended.\n\nThere is also a need for reduction in the business tax system. Canadian businesses are competing globally and they must be allowed the leeway to do so. During the public consultations we were made clearly aware of how badly infrastructure revitalization is needed. Comments were made by people from all regions of Canada about how roads and highways are in dire need of work.\n\nAs a nation which relies heavily on roadway transportation, whether it is the automotive industry in Ontario or supplies being transported to Fort Nelson, B.C., we must invest in infrastructure. Therefore we have recommended a $2.5 billion federal infrastructure program. Not only would such a program mark an important contribution to the well-being and safety of all Canadians, it would create hundreds of new jobs and stimulate the local economy in many regions of the country.\n\nOn the issue of homelessness and affordable social housing, Canadians are demanding action.

I was disturbed to learn that 50,000 condominium owners in British Columbia have been badly served by a systemic government failure at the federal, provincial and municipal levels which has left the 50,000 homeowners with repair bills in each case on average of $24,000 to $25,000.\n\nThe PC Party of Canada supports allowing eligible homeowners to withdraw up to $20,000 of their RRSPs without penalty for use in repairs to be repaid over 15 years. Additionally, we would support the government matching the provincial government's sales tax relief with a GST rebate on qualified repairs and renovations for leaky condominiums. We would also allow an income tax deduction for repair expenses for the condominium owners.\n\nWould the hon. member support these tax measures which would address the issues for the leaky condominium owners?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will say at the outset that you need not apologize to me for getting my point of order confused. I was a bit confused myself. It was the spirit of the need for haste which threw me off.\n\nI am very honoured to participate in the prebudget debate. Having sat through the morning and now part of the afternoon on this issue, a couple of things strike me and I want to point out a few things. I am not on the finance committee. This is not an apology, but I am trying to bring a different perspective to the issue.\n\nI have taken a quick look at the document we have been referencing as well as the minority reports from the various parties. It is very clear that it is an extremely hardworking committee. Understandably and not surprisingly, various parties are taking traditional stands on issues. I think if we put the entire package together, including the minority reports, we have a good handle on the numbers which make our economy work.\n\nOn the issue of tax cuts, we have been around that a number of times. That argument is over. It is very clear the government needs to address the level of taxation.\n\nWe make a mistake if we assume that tax cuts are it. I do not argue for a minute that tax cuts are not part of it; what I suggest is that tax cuts are not all of it. What I am hearing from some speakers is that this is somehow a panacea to make the economy work in some magical way: let us eliminate government altogether; let us cut taxes so much that we are actually giving money to be Canadians. I do not know where this ridiculous argument ends.\n\nIf we look at the forces at play in our economy today, especially globalization, dismantling and devolving the federal government at this time is sheer lunacy. It is very opportune politics to go around and ask people if they think they pay too much tax. We would have to go into many doughnut stores before we would find somebody who said, “No, I want to pay more”.\n\nIt is fundamentally misleading to talk about American level taxation unless we want to talk about American level social spending. If Canadians are confronted with that reality they may say that yes, everybody wants to pay less tax, but what they really want is to get value for their expenditures. I want to leave the numbers aside because it is not all about numbers.\n\nI listened with great interest to my Reform colleague. I would suggest to him that somehow burying our heads in a pail of pay stubs is not going to provide the vision that Canadians will require in terms of leadership from the federal government on the verge of the new millennium. We have to look for that kind of balance.\n\nWe certainly had a short term crisis. With a $42 billion deficit we were essentially up to our ass in alligators, but we are over that now. Through the fiscal management and commitment of all Canadians and the hard work of the committee, we got ourselves to a crossroads. The decisions we have to make at that crossroads are whether we will continue to have our planning horizon mirror the election cycle or will we think three, four, five, six, seven generations down the line and start making some of the decisions that will make our economy sustainable.\n\nThe number of people who are in on this debate is interesting. It took the premier of Ontario all of 24 hours to break his self-imposed rule that he was not going to comment on areas of federal jurisdiction. The premier of Ontario is calling on the federal government to put in a balanced budget law which essentially makes it illegal to run a deficit. It is big brother at its worst, that somehow we can come up with decision making algorithms and eliminate the human side of government altogether, that we can put these things in a formula and the computers will govern the country for us.\n\nSurprisingly I have to say that I agree with Mr. Harris. We should not go into deficits in this country but I would argue that his definition of deficit is far too narrow. I would gladly support statutory regulations that prevent us from going into social deficits and from going into environmental deficits as well because that is where we have some very serious problems. I would like us to address literacy issues with the same vigour that we are addressing some of the tax reforms that members are talking about today.\n\nIn terms of specific areas for tax reform, as a member of the subcommittee on persons with disabilities I would offer as a suggestion, and unfortunately it did not make the report, that we need to look at the way the tax system treats people with disabilities. They are required to use the medical exemption which is an exemption designed for catastrophic health events in a person's life on an ongoing basis. This is a very difficult deduction for people with disabilities to make.\n\nI hope and trust that our government, as we flavour the next budget as a children's budget, will make sure we capture in that envelope children with disabilities. It is important that all Canadians share in the economic growth that we have been enjoying in the last few years.\n\nI listened with great interest to my Conservative colleague who is, I understand, an economist. I am not, although I must say I held up my end of the bell curve in a few economics classes. He talked rather flippantly about having a hypocrisy tax on the Liberals and somehow that would get us out of debt. In all seriousness, I would suggest to him that maybe we should put in place a failure to learn from one's mistakes tax because of the Conservative's stand on the referendum law. That party's members need to learn the lesson of sitting around the table with separatists when trying to run this country. It is not too late for them to change their mind. The Reform Party did it and it seems to have worked. They need to come onboard, but I will leave that alone because it is obviously salt in a widening wound.\n\nI do want to recognize the NDP member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar on his maiden speech. I thought it was an excellent speech. The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle then got up and again picked up on some very positive themes. They are themes I am mirroring here today in terms of there being more to it than economics and crunching the numbers.\n\nThe member from Regina then made a fatal mistake when he talked about half the surplus going to spending, half going to debt reduction and half going to tax reduction. Apart from being impossible in terms of geometry, it is that third half of money that the NDP does not have a sense of reality about. We have to pay for these things. To somehow invent a new half, apart from the fact that it defies the laws of physics, it also does not resonate with voters. Having gone through the debt and the deficit and the cycle of spending and taxing, the voters understand that at the end of the day we have to pay the piper. We cannot spend money we do not have. It is a rather old adage but it does not hurt to remind ourselves of that from time to time.\n\nI will touch on the repeated references to the GDP. It is a real fallacy in the country when we link our well-being to gross domestic product. Economic indicators are important but they do not tell the whole story.\n\nLet us consider the fact that when children get asthma because of air pollution, the price of their inhalers is added to the GDP. When we have wells go bad in rural Canada because of groundwater problems, rural Canadians buy bottled water, and that is added to the GDP. When people replace stolen property or put security systems in their homes, that increases our GDP. When the insurance industry has to spend billions of dollars, as it did in eastern Ontario after the ice storm, because of increasingly violent weather events, our GDP goes up. When planes crash off of Peggy's Cove, our GDP goes up. As a nation and as the new millennium is looking us in the face, the beans need to be counted but we do not govern by the numbers.\n\nIt is not unlike driving a bus full of Canadians barrelling down the road, staring at the speedometer. From repeated consultations I have had with groups across the country, the people of Canada are looking out the windows. They are expecting the government to take some leadership, certainly in the area of sustainable economies, but they also want to see us move toward sustainable social systems where all people share in the benefits that are generated and certainly in sustainable environmental policies. At the end of the day, air, water and soil are fundamentally important to the well-being of Canadians.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time. I am pleased to speak today on the prebudget allotted time. However, I have to question this exercise which has gone on for months now. The finance committee has travelled across the country hearing from every group of the political spectrum. I was on this committee for some of its travels and I sat through many of the hearings here on the Hill.\n\nThe all-party Standing Committee on Finance has now filed its prebudget report with the House. It is entitled “Budget 2000: New Era, New Plan”, and has 45 recommendations. My prediction is that the finance minister's budget will not resemble our committee's recommendations, just as it has been every year with the Liberals in government.\n\nThe feedback I received from across the country centred around tax relief. Not every group that presented testimony called for tax relief. Many Liberals and socialists were calling for further program spending. In fact, I am certain that some would like to see the entire surplus put toward spending initiatives. They would choke us all with big government. However, I would say that the majority spoke passionately about the need for tax relief. Whether it was relief on the capital gains tax, income tax or just taxes in general, the theme was the same.\n\nGetting back to the committee, the members of parliament on both sides of the House spent much time listening to the grassroots tell them what was needed in the next federal budget. At the end of the day, members will ask themselves if it was worth it. We in the House know that the committee passed a controversial amendment on the unwise 50:50 plan of spending balanced with tax relief and debt reduction only to have this reversed the next when the word came down.\n\nCommittees in this place are run like a dictatorship. It is the government's way or it is no way. Canadians need to know that their voices mean little to this administration as evidenced over the years by what the government has brought forward in policy. Walter Robinson of the Taxpayers Federation makes the parallel of the prebudget to a Hollywood movie. The previews look really good, but when we show up and pay we are really disappointed.\n\nReform has, from its inception, been calling for tax relief. Reformers are not alone in this view. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants said that tax reduction would significantly increase economic growth and employment. The Certified General Accountants Association agree. The International Monetary Fund is pushing for Canada to abandon its 50:50 plan and begin tackling the $570 billion debt more aggressively, in addition to giving extensive tax relief.\n\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce does not want to see tax reduction take a back seat to new program spending. The C.D. Howe Institute says that Canadians are underemployed, overtaxed and unproductive in comparison to many of our trading partners. The OECD says that Ottawa should give the highest priority to cutting personal taxes, accelerating its reductions in EI surpluses and work with provincial governments to lower business taxes.\n\nThese are respectable groups in the financial community. They are all saying the same thing, of what is a wise course to build a better country for everyone, especially for those of low or no income. How can the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and the caucus be so out of touch with reality?\n\nCanadians know about the Liberal plan and they know that is much about image, about favouring the sectors that support them and about playing the role of benevolence to an electorate that is supposed to be appreciatively grateful for what it has done for them. In other words, the more surplus the more lolly the ministers can dole out to friends in their ridings. A case in point is the transitional jobs fund for which the Liberals' behaviour with just that one program should be evidence enough for them to be sent packing after the next election.\n\nReform has a great plan, a plan that will bring Canada back to standing firmly on sound economics and fiscal responsibility, capable of protecting Canadians from troubles in other countries. Much of it has been laid out in the committee minority report and I urge everyone to read it.\n\nMany of my colleagues before me have spoken at length about our plan, and I will try again to highlight a few of the points.\n\nFirst, we would scrap the unwise 50:50 promise. I think if we asked Liberal members today most would agree. Members across may scoff at this, but if this were not true, why did such an amendment pass the committee last week? This is an embarrassment for them because they know we are correct. They know that the Liberal members who voted in favour of scraping the 50:50 in committee are correct. The kind of underhanded scheming that went on in the finance committee to change it in the last minute was deplorable.\n\nSecond, Reform would reduce the capital gains tax. I will refer to the United States for a minute to show a chronology of what happened when it tinkered with the capital gains tax rate. Between 1970 and 1977, the capital gains tax in the United States increased. Revenues collected from this tax decreased. In 1978, the rate was cut sharply and revenues soared. In 1987, the rate was raised again and revenues stagnated. In 1997, the rate was in the 10% to 20% range and the result was that revenues from the adjustment increased by 40%. The numbers do not lie. Why is the minister and the government ignoring what is so plain and simple to everyone else?\n\nThird, Reform would eliminate bracket creep. I will read what the OECD said about bracket creep. It stated:\n\nThe burden on Canadian taxpayers has increased over the last several years largely as a result of a non-indexed tax system. The lack of full indexation has pushed around 20 per cent of tax filers into higher tax brackets over the past ten years, resulting in increasing average tax rates at all income levels (although proportionately more for low- and middle-income individuals).\n\nLet us say that the average worker receives a cost of living raise, that person could possibly be moved into a higher tax bracket, pay higher taxes and in fact probably never notice the raise. That person may even see their income decrease.\n\nIn the past 12 years, bracket creep has pulled more than a million low income Canadians into the income tax net. Most of these are the working poor who, under the Reform plan, would pay no tax.\n\nI find it interesting that the Liberals, who have always pretended to take the side of the disadvantaged, would not be doing everything in their power to eliminate bracket creep. Reformers, on the other hand, are advocating fairness for Canadians. Why will the Liberals not follow suit? They are raising revenue via the back door. It is underhanded and it is simply wrong.\n\nFourth, Reform would hold the line on spending. This is something dear to the hearts of the Liberals, the desire to spend. Next to the NDP, no other political party in the country spends like the Liberals. Spending allows cabinet ministers to dole out sweet deals to their supporters. We do not have to look any further than the transitional jobs fund, a program for creating jobs in federal ridings where the unemployment rate is supposed to be above 12%. According to the national accounts of Canada, government program spending has never been higher than it is today.\n\nLet us take a look at the numbers. In 1997-98, the Liberals overspent by $2.95 billion or 2.79%. Budget 1997 planned spending was $105.8 billion; actual spending was $108.8 billion. It gets worse. In 1998-99, the Liberals overspent by $6.9 billion or 7%. Budget 1998 planned expenditures were $104.5 billion but actual spending was $111.4 billion.\n\nIn 1999-2000, all indications point again to overspending and a budget plan that already has in it fat, questionable categories.\n\nFarmers in the prairies are suffering, yet the government says that it has no money. The RCMP is understaffed in British Columbia, yet the government put millions into a flawed gun registration program. The residential crisis of leaky condos in British Columbia cries out for help, yet the Liberals are nowhere.\n\nReform is not saying that government should not spend money. What we are calling for is control on spending and a more reasonable reallocation. Where is the expenditure management program that was once in place? This needs to be a permanent fixture whether or not there is a surplus.\n\nI could go on and on about the fiscal mismanagement of the Liberals since they took office in 1993. They are truly not wise managers of the public trust. There needs to be a change in the leadership of this country. I am not referring to the current Prime Minister stepping down, for when I look at the team bench, the replacements would not help very much. Canadians are asking for a fundamental change in the direction of the country, not the Liberal version of the so-called balance.\n\nLet us reform the budget so that some day the working poor will pay no income tax, so that some day seniors on fixed incomes will no longer fear the taxman coming, so that some day all taxpayers will pay the same percentage rate of taxation, so that some day the federal government will live within modest means and help rather than hurt, and so that some day we will have viable universal medicare for everyone.\n\nReform's fiscal responsibility message has been virtually the same since its inception. I can only imagine how strong Canada would be today had our policies been put into place. Canada's story is one of missed opportunity, but we are ready and we have the plan. We have the vision, the vision to lead, the competence to manage and the compassion to provide.",

Let us take a look at what they are talking about, and then I will pose my question to the member.\n\nIn Canada there are 30 million people. Of those, there are 14 million taxpayers. If we gave each taxpayer back $100 in a tax break across the board, it would cost the federal government $1.4 billion.\n\nWhat is a hundred bucks? It is nothing. The taxpayer will probably want $1,000 or close to the $2,500 the Reform Party is talking about. That $1,000 would cost the Government of Canada $14 billion. The $2,500 that the Reform Party is tossing about would amount to almost $40 billion.\n\nIf the hon. member does all this spending and cuts all this money out of revenue, does this mean to say that the Reform Party will take Canada back into deficit spending?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak to the prebudget debate.\n\nIt is appropriate to mention that as we close the House that we have some 4,500 Canadians serving abroad in the Canadian armed forces on missions who will not be sharing this holiday season with their families. I think the House would join me in congratulating those members of the Canadian armed forces for their hard work in the year 1999 and to wish them the very best this holiday season.\n\nMy subject today on the prebudget debate will be defence. In 1994 the federal government formed the special joint committee to review Canada's defence policy to answer the question of what principles, purposes and objectives should guide our government in setting defence policy in a rapidly changing world.\n\nThe special joint committee of which I was a member studied the issue for eight months and literally interviewed hundreds of witnesses from coast to coast and internationally. The special joint committee concluded that there was a limit to which defence spending cuts and personnel reductions could go without compromising the combat capability of the Canadian armed forces.\n\nWe recommended to the Liberal government at that time in 1994 that the Department of National Defence should maintain a core budget of at least $10.5 billion and personnel levels of the regular force were not to fall below 66,700. I stress that at that time these figures were absolute minimums. Any cuts below these figures would require a corresponding decrease in the commitments of our troops and any increase in commitments would require additional funding to the department.\n\nIn response the Liberal government issued its 1994 white paper which laid out the groundwork for its declared official defence policy. In the document the government went to great lengths to state officially that it was the policy of the Liberal government to maintain combat capable forces. I quote from that 1994 white paper which states:\n\nThe Government has concluded that the maintenance of multipurpose, combat-capable forces is in the national interest. It is only through the maintenance of such forces that Canada will be able to retain the necessary degree of flexibility and freedom of action when it comes to the defence of its interests and the projection of its values abroad.\n\nThe white paper further states:\n\nCanada needs armed forces that are able to operate with the modern forces maintained by our allies and like-minded nations against a capable opponent—that is, able to fight alongside the best, against the best.\n\nSince making these lofty proclamations the Liberal government has broken its stated defence policy by consciously pursuing a defence policy that has literally stripped the Canadian armed forces of combat capability.\n\nThe Liberals have accomplished this in several ways. First, they have begun to pursue a foreign policy based on the fluffy and cuddly concept of soft power and human security. I will quote the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the defence minister's senior, who sees little value in the concept of a combat capable force. In the 1997 issue of the International Journal he stated:\n\nA country's image is key to the use of soft power. An attractive set of values and an image as a trustworthy partner encourages other countries to consider and weigh our views.\n\nHe referred to soft power by saying that it:\n\n—blurs, even counters, the perception of traditional power assets, such as military force.\n\nThe problem is that this idea of influencing other nations by using Canada's image as a country full of nice folks with nice values just does not work.\n\nLet us look at how influential the foreign affairs minister was with the military junta that took over Pakistan recently. Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs really think Saddam Hussein or Slobadan Milosevic will really mend their ways after hearing about Canada's great values? It just will not happen.\n\nIronically even the creator of the soft power concept, Joseph Nye, understood that soft power meant nothing without hard power or military assets to back up that concept. Also the Liberal government slashed defence spending a whopping 24% to just over $9 billion, far below what was recommended in the 1994 special joint committee report. This has literally gutted the Canadian armed forces.\n\nI believe many of my Liberal colleagues across the way, in particular those who sit on the defence committee, would agree with this point. The Liberal members, the Reform members and the Conservative member supported the defence committee's first report to the House calling for significant increases in defence spending as a percentage of GDP over the next five years. The finance committee has recognized the urgency of the situation and has recommended a five year increase for national defence.\n\nThe results of these massive cuts to defence spending were very predictable. Personnel had to be cut to 60,000, far below that which we recommended in the special joint committee and a dramatic drop from the 87,000 personnel we had in 1987.\n\nAccording to the Conference of Defence Associations that appeared before the defence committee today, this number has fallen to about 56,000 or 57,000 because national defence cannot afford to replace the people it is losing through attrition.\n\nAs we all know manpower is essential to our combat capability. The army is particularly hard hit with personnel at only 65% of what is needed to achieve combat capability. The Conference of Defence Associations told the defence committee today that Canada's forces would be hard pressed to fulfil the Liberal government's 1994 white paper commitment to field a combat capable brigade size force. It argued that the Canadian army is really only combat capable at the company level, which is about 150 troops.\n\nIn Canada, with a population of some 30 million people, we are only capable of fielding a company of 150 personnel that are combat capable. We have seen how stretched our two battalions are in Kosovo and Bosnia. We have to bring home our battalion of 1,300 troops from Kosovo because we cannot effectively sustain two battalions in the region.\n\nThe army is getting so desperate that two weeks ago, members might have read in the press, Colonel Howard Marsh advised the government contrary to the government's own white paper on defence that it should cut the army to 10,000 personnel from the current 20,000 and make up the difference by using high tech gadgets. This idea is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nThe Conference of Defence Associations stated today that even with the army at its current size of 20,000 it is far too small. High tech gadgets will not make up the difference for the crucial role played by highly trained individuals in the army.\n\nJust last month the Conference of Defence Associations stated during hearings before the finance committee that the Canadian forces were on the verge of a major breakdown in combat capability, unless the defence budget was increased by at least $500 million, climbing to $1.5 billion over the next few years.\n\nIt is important for me to mention again the mismanagement of the Sea King helicopters by the Liberal government. We have been waiting for six years for a replacement for the Sea King helicopter. Canadians still wait and this is unacceptable. We probably will not have replacement helicopters until the year 2008. They are literally falling apart. Pieces are flying through the air from Sea King helicopters. They need to be replaced and they need to be replaced now.\n\nThe Liberal government has broken its stated defence policy which claims Canada must have combat capable forces. Instead the Liberal government has consciously pursued a defence policy that has stripped our Canadian forces of much of its combat capability.\n\nBefore we get to the point of no return the official opposition calls on the Liberal government to increase defence spending by at least $2 billion over the next two years to reverse this decline in the combat capability of the Canadian armed forces.",

The Minister of National Defence continually leads the Canadian public to believe that we do not have a serious problem with our defence forces and that every time a mission comes up it seems Canada is able to respond very quickly. The problem is that places tremendous stress on our troops. At this time, some 4,500 army troops are serving outside the country. That means three times that amount are needed to maintain that 4,500 figure. The reason is that 4,500 people are training to go on that mission, there are the 4,500 who are deployed on that mission already, and then recuperation time is needed, so there are another 4,500 people who have just returned from the mission and are taking time with their families and undergoing debriefing and training opportunities.\n\nThe whole concept of Canada's always being there and deploying more people with the budget constantly declining and the government foisting more missions on the armed forces is a very desperate situation that has come to a crossroads. We like to point these things out constantly to the Canadian public, but we always hear quite the opposite from the defence minister and the foreign affairs minister that everything seems to be fine. The Canadian public should realize this is a desperate situation.\n\nThe Canadian public has given its support to the Canadian armed forces in the missions we operate in around the world. It is time for the government to give the people in the Canadian armed forces the tools they need to do their job, whether it be peacekeeping or whether it be a combat role in hot spots around the world.",

The Liberal government has already implemented tax cuts of 10%.\n\nIn their platform they talk about a tax cut package that in the third year of their proposal would cost the federal treasury $26 billion. They also talk about an equal amount against paying down the debt. That is $26 billion in year three for tax cuts and $26 billion for paying down the debt. If my arithmetic is correct, that is $52 billion. When I look at the document released by the finance minister a month ago and the surpluses projected forward by 11 of Canada's leading economists, it shows that in year three the surplus would be at a level of $12.5 billion.\n\nThen the other Reform member was talking about increased expenditure on defence. Other members of the Reform Party have talked about increased expenditures on farm income relief. How does the arithmetic add up? How does this package fit?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to talk about the first report of the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nFirst I would like to talk about the process because the content of the report is only as good as the process that preceded it. Coming from Women's College Hospital in Toronto where the motto was non quo sed quomodo, it is not what we do but how, I would like to celebrate the fact that this is a process by which our Liberal government can be extraordinarily proud.\n\nNo longer, as with previous governments, does the budget get written in secret after a series of one on one meetings with the finance minister, clearly influenced only by those who were able to secure such a meeting, largely because of their elevated positions in society.\n\nWith all the committee hearings and submissions and the town hall meetings held by 62 of our members of parliament, we feel that Canadians have been properly consulted. It is not surprising therefore that the Minister of Finance's budgets are so well received when people can see their own advice in the budgets as they are tabled.\n\nAs the member of parliament for St. Paul's I believe that the best antidote to the cynicism and apathy that really threatens our democracy is a commitment to real consultation and the participation of citizens in the policy process. Citizen engagement must be genuine and it is not good enough that governments and parliamentarians consult. Citizens must feel that they are being given the opportunity to actually shape public policy.\n\nMr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oak Ridges.\n\nPeter Newman said that politics in Canada has always been the art of making the necessary possible. Therefore deciding what is necessary must be a political decision. Deciding what is necessary must be done by politicians in true partnership with the citizens.\n\nThe prebudget consultation is an excellent example of a process whereby all Canadians have the opportunity to provide input into the priorities that define our country. The budget making process is where we receive input into the tools we have at our disposal to help ensure that the necessary becomes possible: debt retirement, taxation as well as tax relief, and strategic investments in program spending.\n\nThis year I had the opportunity to chair four consultations on the budget; a town hall in St. Paul's, an invitational round table in St. Paul's, a special meeting of the Liberal women's caucus with the finance minister, as well as yesterday's round table of the subcommittee on persons with disabilities on the tax treatment of persons with disabilities and families with children with disabilities.\n\nThe first such consultation which was submitted to the finance committee was held in St. Paul's on November 8. The clear consensus in the room was that affordable housing was extraordinarily important to all issues around the true disposable income of Canadians, and that all levels of government must do whatever they can to make shelter possible for all Canadians.\n\nThere was also a clear consensus on the need for proper tax relief, that the amount of disposable income families have is for snowsuits and snow boots for kids. Families, in particular low and middle income families, need to have money to spend, and this year as we focus on children it should be for their children.\n\nThere is no question that in terms of our economy the need for a vibrant and accountable health care system was agreed upon by everyone in the room, as well as employment strategies and a focus on the environment.\n\nWhile affordable housing and tax relief topped the list of budgetary suggestions at the meeting, it was clear there were underlying issues to be addressed. The constituents of St. Paul's wanted to know that they were receiving good quality social services for their tax investments. They were asking the federal government to take the initiative in protecting the things they value most as Canadians: access to shelter, a quality health care system, employment, and protection of the environment for future generations.\n\nIn this new age of surplus, constituents would like to see measurable outcomes that demonstrate that their taxes are being well spent. They would like to have confidence that we will ensure that basic needs of all Canadians are met. They understand that good social spending is also good economic spending and economic policy and will result in a secure future for all Canadians.\n\nAt our prebudget round table, it was interesting that a consensus emerged on the need for the federal government to articulate a clear, long term economic and social vision based on Canadian values. Like the finance committee, they felt that we should be rolling out a vision over more than one year. Their issues of greatest concern were tax relief, debt reduction, poverty, homelessness and the children's agenda.\n\nAll in attendance felt that the government must lead the way in long term planning, setting outcomes and filling the gaps within a framework that reflects Canadian values. They wanted to ensure that good social policy was viewed as good economic policy. The consensus was that in order for us to maintain a decent social infrastructure, growing the pie and the economic strength of our country are extraordinarily important in reaching that goal.\n\nAt the round table, they felt we must ensure that productivity in the growth of the country occurs. It must be addressed in a long term, systemic way. If the government were to articulate long term plans, people would see their needs as being met. The feeling was that the government must not expect to run every aspect of life, but it must recognize clearly where it has a long term impact and harmonize its actions with other levels and partners to ensure its long term success. They wanted frequent reviews of government programs to see how effective they have been upon implementation to ensure that outcomes are being met.\n\nWe felt extremely heartened by the new efforts and initiatives of the treasury board to look at outcomes and the performance indicators of those outcomes in terms of the future of smart spending in the country and in knowing that we will fund programs only if they are shown to be, as we used to call in medicine, evidence based practice.\n\nAt their meeting the Liberal women's caucus reflected what they had been hearing in their constituencies. It was a very similar shopping list in terms of the budget. A lot of those things have been reflected in the finance committee report.\n\nWhat was not in the finance committee report but the women's caucus feels strongly about, is that all aspects of public policy, in particular budget items, require a gender based analysis. We must make sure that there is no discrimination of gender by all policies and it must be done before things come to the point of being a budget allocation. We were heartened by the commitment of the Minister of Finance to meet with the Secretary of State for the Status of Women and the President of the Treasury Board to actually look at how that could be articulated.\n\nYesterday it was extremely interesting to receive the experts on the issue of tax and families with disabilities. I would like to draw members' attention to some of the things that were articulated at yesterday's meeting. I am thrilled that a lot of these things were in the finance committee report, but I would like to underline the things that we feel most strongly about or that there would seem to be consensus at the round table about.\n\nDefending the child tax deduction for parents of children with disabilities would clearly benefit both low and middle income earners. The experts wanted to see an index or an adjustment to the various credits and deductions claimed by persons with disabilities and their families to deal with the increasing cost to them due to the lack of indexation. They wanted more technical aids and services added to the list of expenses for the medical expense tax credit. Clearly there was a consensus to broaden the definition of eligibility in the disability tax credit.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about people with cystic fibrosis. For some reason in the current definition of disability, in activities related to daily living, breathing has been left out. People who have a great deal of difficulty breathing are not included in the disability tax credit. We feel that is a modest expansion that would seriously help the 600 to 900 adults with cystic fibrosis to participate as full citizens.\n\nWe are requesting that the Canada study grants received by persons with disabilities be not treated as taxable income.\n\nThere was interest in a new savings vehicle modelled on the registered retirement savings plan that would encourage private savings to support individuals with mental and physical disabilities.\n\nWe think there should be more generous and consistent tax treatment of the costs of attendant care and that the income tax guide should be clarified so that taxpayers with disabilities and their families can more clearly understand the applicable tax measures and act accordingly.\n\nWe were thrilled to see in the finance committee report strong support for the renewal of the opportunities fund, and we are hoping for accessibility standards that would become benchmarks in the national children's agenda.\n\nIt is extremely heartening to see so many of the social infrastructure programs clearly identified in the finance committee report.",

As we know from some of the briefs, 60% of the things that are being done in health care, as we speak, have never been subjected to any sort of evidence based practice. As was recommended in the finance committee report, we have to make sure that there is money for information technology and the ability to practise evidence based medicine as well as research into health care delivery. We need proper data in terms of how we deliver health care.\n\nA lot of us were very impressed by the University of Ottawa and Queen's University study of the sustainability of the health care system. It showed that if we actually moved to best practices, or moved people to the right level of care, there would be $7 billion in savings annually in Canada. Many briefs said that this was not about dollars, it was about mismanagement. We need a real system instead of this patchwork quilt of non-systems.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to participate in the debate on the upcoming year 2000 budget.\n\nThrough successive budgets the government has continued to build on a strong fiscal foundation that began in 1993. At that time our economic condition was in a serious state of disrepair. We had a $42 billion deficit, high unemployment and sluggish investor confidence.\n\nSince 1993 the government has rolled up its sleeves and presented to Canadians a clear vision of how to get things straight. Canadians understood that large deficits and an astronomical debt would cripple Canada for generations to come if we did not act, and act we did. Canadians embraced the deficit reduction strategies of the government. Together we have been able to eliminate the deficit, bring in balanced budgets and forecast further balanced budgets.\n\nIn 1998-99 Canada balanced the books for the first time since 1951-52. The government has continued to operate deficit free. For the coming millennium we will continue our prudent spending, continue to balance the books and offer Canadians further tax cuts. I can think of no greater gift to offer young people, our future generations, than a deficit free government, lower taxes and a strong economic and fiscal atmosphere that supports growth and development by continued investment in the talents of our youth.\n\nIn February 2000 the Minister of Finance will continue on this path by announcing further tax cuts for Canada. I have always been a strong advocate of calling for tax cuts. Many of my constituents want tax cuts as well. I recently conducted a survey in my riding asking constituents what they would like to see in the upcoming budget. Close to 75% of those who responded chose tax cuts and debt reduction as the top two issues that needed to be addressed in the upcoming federal budget. Continued funding for health care in Canada ranked a close third, at 70%.\n\nI would like to share some of the direct comments of my constituents with the House today: “Lower taxes, both personal and corporate, can help to create and retain jobs in Canada. Tax cuts should focus more on lower and middle income people and families”. “I believe lower national debts are a key foundation to a stronger economy and the benefits of long term growth. Get the debt behind us and Canada can become a stronger nation”. “Continued fiscal responsibility, as already demonstrated by Mr. Martin, is required”. “Seeing as children and youth are our priority, the only responsible action in the federal budget is to make debt payment the top and only priority for surplus funds. It is not fair to the next generation to burden them with debt created by this generation”.\n\nIt is clear that Canadians know what they want. They want a fiscally responsible government which is willing to take action to end the overspending of the past and to make sure that we have cleared the slate for future generations. By getting our fiscal house in order we can concentrate on other issues. We can create an atmosphere where job creation strives and where Canadian entrepreneurs can make their mark in the global economy.\n\nThis past November the finance minister brought down his economic and fiscal update. He noted that Canada's economy has made tremendous strides. The economy is now forecast to grow by 3.6% this year, based on the average of private sector forecasts. That is a significant jump from the 2% growth rate that economists were forecasting just before last February's budget.\n\nFor the year 2000 the average growth forecast is 2.9%, again an increase over the 2.5% predicted at the time of the budget. This has brought our November 1999 unemployment rate down by 0.3 percentage points to 6.9%. That is the lowest level since August 1981.\n\nOur future as a country is indeed bright. The government will continue its commitment to Canadians through strong, continued funding for our world renowned universal health care system. We will provide tax cuts.\n\nWe also recognize that Canada is a place for business. We have taken great strides to make this so. We recognize the value of innovation, but we know that innovation does not just happen. It requires an investment on our part. It requires infrastructure. We are committed to building a society of security and opportunity by helping Canadians to acquire education, knowledge and skills.\n\nWe will provide continued funding to help our youth reach their goals and dreams through the youth employment strategy, the Canadian opportunities strategy and the Canada education savings grant.\n\nFinally, I want to speak briefly about another program. I fully support the joint federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program. The Speech from the Throne committed the government to developing a five year physical infrastructure plan with the provinces and territories. It is a prime example of how governments can work together for the good of all Canadians.\n\nI look forward with great anticipation to the next federal budget. As the first budget of our new millennium it will set a benchmark for all future budgets. It will clearly demonstrate our commitment to providing Canadians with an efficiently run, fiscally responsible government, and continued investment in the programs and services Canadians have come to expect and deserve.",

In 1993, the government adopted the national infrastructure program of the FCM.\n\nTraditional infrastructure is roads, sewers, bridges and water. The announcement in the Speech from the Throne clearly indicates all three orders of government participating. Municipally driven is what I would like to see. I would like to see that we are involving all orders of government in a process by which we have at the moment basically a $40 billion deficit in infrastructure in the areas that I have just outlined. There is no question that over 125,000 direct and indirect jobs were created by the last national infrastructure program.\n\nOne of the things that varies in the proposals in the Speech from the Throne is that we actually have a blueprint for five years. We think this is critical when we look at our competition, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. I know that every member in the House benefited from the national infrastructure program. The mayors of the communities in these members' ridings, including my good friends across the way in the Reform Party, have benefited very much. There are some former mayors over there.\n\nThe program delivered both in terms of job creation and in speeding up needed infrastructure programs. I say to my hon. friend that there is no question that by involving all orders of government, we will be able to improve our economy by being able to move people, certainly through roads being reconstructed—",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this most important debate. First of all, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Jonquière.\n\nAfter reading the report stemming from the prebudget hearings, which was tabled in the House, one can tell that a great deal of ambiguity remains concerning the direction the Minister of Finance intends to take with the budget to be tabled on or about February 22 or February 29, 2000.\n\nEvery year, the Bloc Quebecois brings out statistics to support its criticism of what I always refer to as cooking the books, something the Minister of Finance is indulging in with increasing frequency.\n\nFor several years now, the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for a number of things, and I think that the Bloc Quebecois is the party that best defends Quebec's interests. We have called for tax cuts, a return to a real EI system, and the return of social transfer payments to Quebec and the provinces; we have called for support for productive projects, moderate debt reduction, and significant efforts to combat poverty.\n\nThis is the gist of what the Bloc Quebecois puts forward annually at this time of the year, when the chair of the Standing Committee on Finance presents the committee's report.\n\nIn Lotbinière, as everywhere else, we took part in this democratic process, in order to find out what the people of Lotbinière wanted. Like all taxpayers in Quebec and in Canada, the people in my riding want lower taxes, but not along the lines the Minister of Finance is suggesting. We want tax cuts for those who contributed most to helping the federal government eliminate the deficit.\n\nThis means a tax cut targeted at the middle class. As for middle class, let me explain what I mean. Statistically, middle class in Canada means those earning between $30,000 and $70,000 a year.\n\nIn a riding like my own of Lotbinière, or like Jonquière or any others with the same characteristics, semi-urban, semi-rural, the middle class is not earning between $30,000 and $70,000 a year; often it is earning $15,000, $20,000 or $25,000.\n\nThese people often work 40 hours a week, at an hourly rate of $8, $9 or $10, and have a lot of trouble making ends meet. They are also greatly affected these days by the price of gasoline.\n\nWhen travelling throughout Quebec, people probably notice that the price of gasoline is quite high in urban centres like Quebec City and Montreal. However, if they travel 100 or 150 kilometres to regions like Jonquière, Rimouski and Abitibi, they will see that the price of gasoline in these areas is very high. What does that mean?\n\nEver since inflation started to skyrocket in the mid-seventies, the price gasoline has had a major impact on the price of consumer products. When the price of gasoline goes up, the trucker who delivers the goods has to increase his rate. Once on the shelves, the goods have to be sold at a higher price, and the consumer who buys them also has to pay more for gasoline.\n\nThis is a real problem for the regions. In the budget being prepared for the year 2000, it is anticipated that the government will include no measure to help these people, even though we are now facing this indirect inflation created with the complicity of the oil companies.\n\nI will come back to this issue, because in the year 2000, as the regional development critic for the Bloc Quebecois, along with my hon. colleagues, we will be taking major action, including in the energy sector, which will be discussed at some length.\n\nWe would not want to relive the situation we experienced in the mid-1970s when inflation soared. We know what it did to the economy of Quebec and Canada.\n\nI would also like to talk about an issue near and dear to my heart which, once again, goes unmentioned the report tabled by the Standing Committee on Finance, namely employment insurance reform. Over the last few weeks, I have been leading an awareness campaign in the riding of Lotbinière, inviting people to sign a petition condemning this situation.\n\nRight now, within the riding of Lotbinière, there are two different rates. The first one is 6.2%, which means that people have to work 660 hours to be eligible for benefits. At the other end of the riding, the rate is 11.2%. This means that people need only work 490 hours. In the same riding, there is a difference of 5%.\n\nWhen people come to see us in our riding offices, it is difficult to explain to them the injustice that comes from the fact that the rate is based on the place of residence. This means that, if two persons work for the same company and that company closes down or experiences a slowdown, one person may be eligible for benefits and the other may be penalized.\n\nWith the same rates, with the same rights, because of the complexity of the map drawn by the Department of Human Resources Development, some people in my riding are severely penalized.\n\nAs recently as this week, someone who thought he would be eligible for benefits with his 635 hours learned that the rate had changed. It came down to 6.2%, and that person left with the sad news that he needed 660 hours to be eligible for benefits. So he did not have a choice, he had to turn to income security.\n\nSometimes the government is proud of the fact that the number of people receiving employment insurance benefits is going down. This is to be expected, because when unemployed workers no longer have access to employment insurance, that have to turn to income security. In the statistics, these people are no longer considered to be part of the labour force. They have been dropped from the statistics.\n\nStatistics are to be used with caution. Yes, the economy is getting stronger. However, we must not forget the terrible consequences of the employment insurance program. A lot of people have to rely on income security now. It is a problem we have in the riding of Lotbinière and in most Quebec ridings.\n\nI want to thank all those who helped me with this initiative in my riding, including the Caisses populaires that circulated the petition and the municipalities that sent resolutions supporting my initiative. Hundreds of people are still signing the petition condemning this social injustice.\n\nDuring the holidays, we will take a break, but in the year 2000, we will be back at it and we intend to hand over to the Minister of Human Resources Development a comprehensive report to make her aware of the social injustice affecting the people of Lotbinière.\n\nThe regions are also faced with problems at the municipal level. When the new governor general delivered the throne speech, we all expected the federal government to announce immediate measures to help the municipalities. The President of the Treasury Board herself told us that they had a project in mind and she believed negotiations were under way.\n\nAnyway, to sum it up, a project might be announced in November or December 2000. There is a desperate need for action now. This measure should already have been announced. Memorandums of understanding should already be under negotiation. Also, financial support for the municipalities should be included in the February 2000 budget.\n\nWe know that the municipalities have to upgrade their infrastructures and that we previously had three party agreements between Quebec, Ottawa and the municipalities that worked just fine. The federal government now has a surplus. I think it is important that the surplus go to areas where the people feel it is most needed: to help the unemployed, to support municipalities and to restore transfers for health care and education.\n\nOur colleagues in the National Assembly, the health and social services minister, Mrs. Marois, and the education minister, François Legault, are having a lot of trouble running their departments because of all the cuts the federal government has made since 1993. Representatives of the federal government say that it has increased transfers. This is a joke, it is utter nonsense.\n\nThe government cut less than it was supposed to be. We know that this government is quite good at marketing. These people are trying to show us how good their government is.\n\nI repeat that the government should reduce taxes to help the middle class, come back to a real employment insurance program, fully restore the social transfers to Quebec and the other provinces, support the positive projects of the municipalities and especially put significant effect into the fight against poverty.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with a certain sadness that I am rising today to take part in the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Finance because there is not much good news in this report tabled just before Christmas. It does not contain many measures to alleviate human suffering and to bring some hope that next year will be better.\n\nOnce again, this report shows the contempt of the Liberal government for the views expressed by the people and by the witnesses who appeared before the finance committee or took part in the prebudget consultations held by my colleagues, the members of the Bloc Quebecois.\n\nInstead of reporting accurately the views expressed by the people who said they wanted surpluses to be reinvested in social programs, the Liberal majority on the committee preferred to be servile and to tell the minister only what he wanted to hear, namely that he can keep his surpluses and use them as he sees fit for measures that are not essential.\n\nThe Standing Committee on Finance and the finance minister deliberately ignore the reality that exists in many regions. They prefer to hide their heads in the sand. The reality is that the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider every day.\n\nI will say a few words about my region. Today, in my region, we have to serve meals to children under 12 who, otherwise, would not be able to take their classes or would get sick.\n\nSome parents are no longer able to serve three meals a day to their children, even if they themselves do not eat their fill. That is the reality the Liberals are ignoring because they prefer to talk about growth, about the economy and so on. During that time, in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, six soup kitchens are helping people to survive all year long.\n\nToday, La soupière de l'amitié of Arvida, in my riding, is holding its eight fundraising campaign with the help of more than 200 volunteers, who collect money to help the underprivileged.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank those volunteers working on the campaign, under the auspices of honorary president Monseigneur Jean-Guy Couture, and thank also the people of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean for their generous support of the less fortunate.\n\nThis government has abandoned the population. There is a growing number of relief agencies and food banks. This situation should not be tolerated. We should never get used to hardship. However, it seems to be a sad reality: this government has created more hardship.\n\nDuring the prebudget hearings, I consulted with the people from my constituency and from Chicoutimi. Incidentally, I would like to thank the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for his document containing realistic suggestions that take into account the real concerns of ordinary people. The people told me that their priorities, with respect to how the budget surpluses the finance minister thinks are his own should be used, are different from the federal government's priorities. They do not want the Minister of Finance to loose sight of the fact that these surpluses are the result of the considerable sacrifices he has imposed through drastic cuts to social programs as well as of not indexing the tax tables and taking money out of the pockets of the middle class.\n\nIncidentally, I thank the hon. member for Lotbinière for his help in the consultations I have held in my riding. I appreciated his co-operation. Many of my constituents have suggested priorities, some of which I would like to mention here.\n\nMany of my constituents do not necessarily want tax reductions; they would rather have the money used to ensure that quality services continue to be provided to seniors, the sick and the young. Many senior citizens who participated in my consultations complained that the money they get from the government and the level of taxation do not take into account the expenses people who live alone are faced with, be it for maintenance or home help, which increase substantially every year.\n\nMany told me that the surplus in the EI fund should be used to help communities through assistance and support programs for the elderly, to help existing small businesses or new ones getting started and to set up an EI fund for young people.\n\nA number of people told me that the surplus the minister is bragging about, which came straight out of the pockets of ordinary citizens, should be used in part to set up assistance, integration and adjustment programs for people between 50 and 60 who are out of work.\n\nI know of several 50 or 60 year old workers in my riding of Jonquière who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs following plant closures and who are left with nothing. They cannot get training, because, as you know, after spending 30 years in a plant, these older workers can hardly go back to school.\n\nI think the government should be sensitive to the needs of these people who are hurting badly. It should restore the POWA program, or a new and improved program that better suited to their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the government is once again turning a deaf ear. It contends that there is nothing wrong, that nobody has to deal with this problem on a daily basis. There are things we have to do for the future. But right now, people are really stuck with this problem, and families are facing considerable hardship.\n\nMost of the people want the government to maintain its social transfers. As you know, the federal government has been cutting transfers to the provinces for social programs since 1993. Many people were furious and spoke against EI, which brings nothing but misery. Ten years ago, EI covered 80% of the workers who lost their jobs. Nowadays, a mere 40% of the workers are eligible, although all of them pay premiums.\n\nI would like to point out that, since 1993, the Liberal government's record with regard to the environment has been dismal. Apart from engaging in jurisdictional wars with the provinces and trying to impose national standards, the federal government has not proposed any concrete measures to reduce pollution.\n\nRegarding the reduction of greenhouse gases, which affect the climate, pollution and health, and involve considerable economic costs, the federal government still has no clear plan and no clear timetable to meet the objectives that it set for itself under the Kyoto agreement.\n\nSeveral environmental groups have adopted a more practical approach and have proposed concrete measures to the Minister of Finance to reduce pollution, such as investing in public transit systems or encouraging the transportation of goods by train, particularly by special railway cars that can carry trucks.\n\nFinally, it is urgent that this government keep its promise to invest in new depollution technologies. There is an approach that we fully support, because it is a concrete measure that would allow industries, farmers and municipalities to reduce their levels of pollution when renewing their equipment or infrastructure.\n\nI will close by saying that in the Jonquière area, as shown in a recent federal study, air pollution reaches very high levels. We are all waiting anxiously for the federal government to co-operate with industries, municipalities and the provincial government to make the air cleaner, which would better reflect the nature of our region.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the prebudget debate. As a member of the finance committee since 1997 I have had the honour to travel across Canada to listen to what Canadians from all walks of life have to say.\n\nI can carefully say that the mood of the Canadian people is that they are quite relieved that the fiscal house of Canada is in order. They are looking forward to more good news. To put it in context, when I became a member of parliament in 1993 and the government took office unemployment in Canada was 11.2%. In addition, we were faced with a $42 billion deficit.\n\nThere is no doubt that each and every Canadian was called on to bear a share of the burden of getting our fiscal house in order. It was an imperative. Not only was unemployment high, not only did we have this deficit, but the debt to GDP was rising. It meant that there was pressure on interest rates. It was a scenario that was not sustainable.\n\nAs a result of the sacrifices that Canadians have made, as a result of the prudence that the government has exercised and as a result of the good fiscal management and fiscal responsibility demonstrated by the government, there is good news.\n\nLet me give a few key points. The real gross domestic product advanced 4.7% in the third quarter of this year, its fourth consecutive quarter. The real consumer spending posted its third consecutive quarter of strong growth with an increase of 4.8%. Real business investment has grown at an average rate of 11.3%. Real goods and services exports surged 15% in the third quarter. The current account balance improved dramatically from a $7 billion deficit to a second quarter surplus of $2.6 billion in the third quarter.\n\nThe healthy economic growth has translated as well into robust job creation. Since December 1997 over 760,000 jobs were created and 199,000 of those new jobs were for young Canadians. The unemployment rate has declined. It is now at a rate of 6.9%. That is its lowest level in Canada since August 1981, virtually a generation ago. Both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD expect Canada to lead G-7 countries in employment growth in 1999 and 2000. Inflationary pressures remain subdued. The consumer price inflation was 2.3% and excluding food and energy the inflation was only 1.6%. Those are technical points but they paint a picture which indicates to Canadians that we have our fiscal house in order.\n\nOn November 2 the Minister of Finance took the opportunity to address Canadians in his annual fiscal update. During that update he laid out the scenario as he saw it, using prudent assumptions and responsible fiscal management, looking at the fundamentals, and accepting the advice of the experts in business and industry and the economists of our country.\n\nI will quote from the closing of his speech which should give Canadians the confidence that the next budget will reflect a step in the right direction of addressing the fact that Canadians have taken a great deal of the burden over all the years we have taken to balance the budget and finally get into a surplus position.\n\nThe finance minister said:\n\nWe will strengthen our economy. We will bring down taxes. We will recast the foundations of individual security. We will forge a culture of innovation. We will build upon our traditional industries and we will build a society that nurtures its children like no other.\n\nCanadians should be very encouraged by the state of the fiscal house of Canada. It is time for Canadians to start discussing the strategies they would like to see in terms of how we put these things in place.\n\nAs the finance committee travelled across Canada and consulted with Canadians, it will come as no surprise to members and to Canadians at large that depending on whom we were talking to at the time the interest areas were certainly different.\n\nYoung people in university talked to us about the cost of education. They asked us if they could get lower tuitions, if they could get better assistance for post-secondary education, a very important and noble request that has to be looked at. At the other end of the spectrum, a growing segment of the Canadian population, our seniors, told us their concerns were the health care system and the social security benefits that allow them to live in the dignity they have earned and to which they are entitled.\n\nSmall businessmen told us that they wanted to see changes in the corporate tax structure for small businesses, the business sector that generates the most jobs in Canada. They wanted to know if they could get an increase in the small business limit from $200,000 to $400,000.\n\nPeople spoke on behalf of families and children before the finance committee. They talked about the fairness and equity of our tax system, the taxation of families with children and the issue of one income versus two. They talked about the EI system. They talked about debt reduction. Large business groups and organizations talked about the need to improve benefits under our registered retirement savings plans because they want to be able to provide for their retirement down the road.\n\nVirtually every segment of society had representation. The disabled had an excellent representation by Community Living which came before us and talked about how important it was to address the needs of the disabled of our country. Disabled persons often do not get an opportunity to enjoy the dignity and quality of life of other Canadians because so much of their time, energies and resources are dedicated to meeting their basic needs of health and dignity of life. It is a very important issue.\n\nMembers would agree, no matter what party they may come from, that the needs of Canadians are diverse. It is incumbent upon the government to balance those needs on a priority basis and to ensure that when the budget comes forward we maintain fiscal prudence. The finance minister reminded us that we will not go back to a deficit ever again. Canadians can bank on that. The application of fiscal prudence and fiscal responsibility will ensure the sustained growth of our economy, which means more people will have jobs, have the dignity of those jobs, and enjoy Canadian life as every other Canadian.\n\nIt really gets down to productivity. We had a study last year in the finance committee on productivity. In that study there was some disagreement among the experts about what it really meant, but I think they all concurred that at the end of the day it was really an issue of how we improve the quality of life for all Canadians.\n\nIn some ways we can do that by delivering benefits directly to Canadians. In other ways it can be done through stimulating the economy or through the economic sector so that we increase the size of the pie and there is more to share with all Canadians. There are many decisions to be made and they should not be taken lightly. We have to acknowledge the important needs of all Canadians regardless of their state in life. I will be splitting my time with the member for Wentworth—Burlington.\n\nMy final comments will be with regard to the report of the subcommittee of the finance committee that dealt with the taxation of families. In that report there were four recommendations. The first was to extend parental leave under the employment insurance system to a full year for maternity benefits. It is a very important initiative. I am very pleased that the government has embraced it and will be pursuing it in the next budget.\n\nWe recommended that the government look at how to amend the Canada pension plan system to assist Canadians who withdrew from the paid labour force to raise a family so that they do not get penalized in the CPP structure. We also recommended that a new benefit be introduced under the Canada child tax benefit to assist families with children. Finally, we asked the government to look at the child care expense deduction under the Income Tax Act to ensure that it continues to meet with policy objectives.\n\nThe report was commented on by many witnesses before the finance committee. I can tell Canadians and all members that its recommendations were well received.",

I thought we were here today to talk about the future, and for sure one of the important issues of the future is to take medicare into the new millennium.\n\nThis is the government that cut $6.2 billion out of transfer payments in 1995. In the last budget it put back in half of what it took out and stretched it out over five years. It has taken 50:50 cost shared arrangements down to, if we really stretch it, a 15% federal share of health care spending in the country. No wonder we have Ralph Klein in Alberta threatening to privatize the system and destroy our universal health care system because the government has nothing with which to stand up in the face of that.\n\nI ask the member very specifically whether the government will have the responsibility to put back at least $1.5 billion into transfer payments for health care. Will it have the integrity to keep to its promises of the last election and the election before that for national home care and pharmacare? Will it have some vision to ensure that we can carry medicare into the new millennium?",

Yes, it has accumulated surpluses, but we must look at how it was done. This government acted in the most cowardly fashion to eliminate its deficit. Only 11% of savings, if I can use that word, came from its own programs. All the rest was achieved at the expense of the provinces, through cuts in their transfer payments for health, post-secondary education and social programs, and at the expense of workers and employers who contribute to the employment insurance fund.\n\nThis approach did allow the government to accumulate surpluses, with the result that, for example, the provinces had to make drastic cuts in health and education to the point where 80% of cuts affecting the Quebec health care system today are the direct result of this government's cuts in transfers to the provinces.\n\nIt is the federal government's fault if it has become so difficult for people to get medical care today.

The year ended March 31, 1998 was the first year we had a balanced budget of some $1 billion. In the last fiscal year reported on it was $2.9 billion. In the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2000 we are looking at a budget surplus of some $2 billion.\n\nWhen we consider the modest surpluses the government has, I wonder what the member has in mind when he suggests that billions and billions of dollars should not have been cut from the spending of governments. We would have still been in deficit. Unemployment would have remained high. Inflation would have increased. Long term debt interest rates would have increased. Canadians' mortgages would have increased. Car loans would have increased.\n\nThere is a balance and I will not deny that all Canadians have to share part of that burden. But let us be clear. When in government it is very important that prudence and fiscal responsibility are exercised to make sure that the changes we have made are sustainable, to ensure we are on a positive track to have continued surpluses, so Canadians can get the tax breaks they have earned, so Canadians can have the health care system they deserve, so that students can be taken care of, so that seniors can be taken care of and so that families with children can be taken care of.\n\nThose are the objectives of a responsible government.

            "text": "moved that Bill C-226, parliamentarians' code of conduct, be read the second time and referred to a committee.\n\nMr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to address my Bill C-226 which sets out to establish a code of official conduct for parliamentarians.\n\nThis bill is realistic. It is reflected in provincial legislatures and other nations' national assemblies. This code of conduct would raise the level of integrity of our parliament. This bill is rooted in very practical and legitimate concerns Canadians hold about their parliament.\n\nI believe the decision not to have this bill votable was a betrayal of the Canadian public. The clauses I have set out in this code of conduct would have been practical and would have raised the whole tenor of this House and of the Senate.\n\nMy first comments to this House of Commons in response to the government's first throne speech were made over two years ago. I quote from that speech:\n\nSo many of our citizens have become so discouraged with our politicians and our political system that they have chosen not to exercise the basic rights for which our forefathers fought and died. But the sad reality is, and it came across loudly and clearly to me during the election campaign, that many citizens have lost faith in their politicians. Politicians were described to me as not really caring, being in it only for themselves or for the money, being dishonest or full of empty promises.... As I stand here today I pledge that I will do my best to put a new face on politics.\n\nThose were my words in 1997.\n\nThis code of conduct sets out to address this very real problem. This bill is being brought forward out of my personal desire to see parliamentarians carry out their responsibilities with honesty, integrity, transparency and in a manner that dignifies the trust placed in them by the electorate.\n\nUnfortunately over the years there has been too much opportunity for people to become cynical, skeptical and pessimistic concerning elected officials. I firmly believe that those entrusted with public office must not only conduct themselves in a manner befitting of that trust, but must also be seen to be carrying out their responsibilities beyond reproach and free from conflict of interest.\n\nThis parliament should have and needs a clear and objective complaint and resolution mechanism available to the public. This private member's bill addresses these issues. My bill is based upon the following principles.\n\nParliamentarians should have the highest ethical standards so as to maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of parliamentarians and parliament.\n\nParliamentarians should perform their official duties and arrange their private affairs in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny.\n\nParliamentarians should avoid placing themselves under any financial or other obligation that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.\n\nParliamentarians upon entering office should arrange their private affairs to prevent real or apparent conflict of interest. If such does arise, it should be resolved in a way that protects the public interest.\n\nParliamentarians should not accept any gifts or personal benefit in connection with their office that may reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity. Parliamentarians would not accept any gift other than those received as a normal expression of courtesy or protocol.\n\nAs well, all parliamentarians under this bill would have to disclose all official travel when the cost exceeds $250 in cases where the trip is not completely paid for by parliament or one of the few officially recognized sponsors.\n\nNo parliamentarian would be permitted to be a party to a contract with the Government of Canada under which the parliamentarian receives a benefit.\n\nParliamentarians would be required to make a disclosure of all assets once every calendar year and would be required to make public disclosure of the nature, although not the value, of all assets each year.\n\nFinally, to ensure that public interest and the highest standards are upheld, there would be an ethics counsellor to advise parliamentarians on any question relating to conduct. The ethics counsellor would enforce the application of the code of conduct. There would also be the creation of a new standing joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on official conduct to review the code and to monitor the ethics counsellor.\n\nI should point out that there are codes of conduct in various forms in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in some provinces in Canada. For example, in B.C. there is the conflict of interest commissioner. In Alberta there is the ethics commissioner. In Saskatchewan there is the conflict of interest commissioner. In Ontario there is the integrity commissioner.\n\nThere are many obvious reasons why having a code of official conduct would benefit all parliamentarians and all Canadians. In terms of the public, I am sure that everyone here would agree that the majority of Canadians has lost confidence in politicians and many hold a negative opinion of the political system. This code would address public cynicism. It would satisfy the expectations of the public and encourage a sense of security in the system.\n\nThe values that this bill promotes are central to rebuilding respect in this institution by Canadians. That is why this code would include a statement of principles that parliamentarians are expected to uphold. The values inherent in this code of conduct are that service in parliament is a public trust. Public interest must be placed ahead of private interest and conflicts of interest must be avoided or resolved.\n\nThis code is not only a disciplinary measure but it also provides an important educational function. The public would like to see such a function instilled in this House and the code sets forth a framework for that kind of education. This code would make it clear what parliamentarians are expected to do in certain situations and would provide an educational function for the guidance of parliamentarians.\n\nI said at the outset that I was disappointed this bill was not deemed votable. There are several criteria to determine whether a bill is votable.\n\nBills and motions if they are to be votable should be drafted in a clear, complete and effective way. This 18 page bill has gone through many drafts and redrafts with the assistance of legislative staff. The bill not only stands the scrutiny of being potentially effective and an operable piece of legislation, but it is one that clearly outlines its goals.\n\nAlso, bills and motions must be constitutional and concern areas of federal jurisdiction. The bill fully meets that criteria.\n\nBills and motions must deal with matters of significant public interest. The conduct of parliamentarians is obviously of considerable public interest.\n\nBills and motions must also deal with matters that are not part of the government's legislative agenda and on which the House of Commons has not had the opportunity to vote during the session under way. As far as I know, Bill C-226 meets these criteria.\n\nIn terms of bills being votable, all other things being equal, higher priorities should be given to items which transcend purely local interests, are not couched in partisan terms or cannot be address by the House in other ways.\n\nClearly Bill C-226 has no given local interest and is fully in the national interest. It would also apply to all parliamentarians, including myself. There is nothing partisan about this particular effort. Members from all parties signed my petition accompanying the bill. I believe strongly that anything we can do to raise the dignity of parliament and parliamentarians in the eyes of the public benefits all of us, both collectively and individually.\n\nSimilar legislation exists in provincial legislatures and other national legislatures. It is neither fanciful nor onerous in its construction and in its potential application. I sincerely believe that the bill meets all the tests of being something that is worthy of being voted on by this honourable body.\n\nI would therefore ask for the unanimous consent of members in the House to deem this bill votable.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-226, the parliamentarians' code of conduct.\n\nI do not question the significance of a bill like the one being put forward by my hon. colleague from Halifax West. In fact, I can well imagine that on such a bill depends all the confidence the public may have in their institutions and in the elected representatives and politicians who are part of these parliamentarian institutions, which are the foundation of our democratic system and of our system of government.\n\nThat being said, I have questions about the surrealistic nature of the debates we are having in the House these days since, at the same time we are discussing a parliamentarians' code of conduct, which, I admit, is a very important issue, the federal government has introduced a bill that challenges the fundamental balance of the federation in which we live.\n\nThis federation was created with the voluntary consent of the provinces of which it is made up. These provinces who freely entered the federation are now being put into a straitjacket so they cannot leave the federation, or at least so the conditions allowing them to leave as freely as they entered are more difficult than ever, making it practically impossible for them to leave.\n\nI would like to stray from the subject for a moment to make a few remarks that seem very important to me since, although I do not deny the importance of the bill introduced by our colleague, I believe there is a much more important debate that must take place, a debate on the very nature of the country in which we live, which leads us to have these kinds of debates on the parliamentarians' code of conduct, on the budget and on all the other issues that must normally be brought to the attention of parliamentarians.\n\nLet us keep in mind that at the time Quebec joined the Canadian federation in 1867, it did not do so based on a simple vote by the legislative assembly of the day. Incidentally, that vote passed by a very slender majority of two seats, if I am not mistaken, among the francophone members. The least one can say, therefore, is that this entry was not the most unanimous possible, far from it in fact. But that is how Quebec entered the federation.\n\nLater, when other provinces came into the federation, the founding members never had to give formal assent to their entry, even though the arrival of new provinces did have a fundamental impact on each of them.\n\nNow they are trying to tell us that consulting the population in a democratic manner, through a referendum, would not be legitimate, would not be the right way to leave this country, whereas in 1867 the population of Quebec was never consulted about entering this federation.\n\nI would respectfully submit that it is legitimate and democratic for Quebec to leave the Canadian federation as freely as it entered it, if that is the wish of its population, and if that wish is expressed by a majority vote, that is a 50% plus one vote.\n\nAcross the floor of this House, they are saying “But there have already been two referendums. How many of them are you going to hold before you get a yes?” That is not the point. In 1980, federalists told Quebecers “If you stay in Canada we will reform this country in such a way that you will feel comfortable in it”. A constitutional reform was indeed undertaken, but Quebec was left out. Quebec never signed the constitutional reform adopted in 1982 and no Quebec premier, whether federalist or sovereignist, was ever prepared to sign it.\n\nThe federalists got a no on the basis of misrepresentation, and the same thing happened again in 1995. On the eve of that referendum, the current Prime Minister, realizing to his great dismay that the sovereignists might win, once again made promises to Quebecers and told them “we will entrench a veto and the concept of distinct society in the constitution”. We saw what happened once again. The government passed a meaningless motion in this House and a veto was given to all the regions of Canada, making it forever all the more difficult to reform the Canadian constitution to accommodate the provinces.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I respectfully submit that it is perfectly legitimate that Quebecers who voted no in 1980 and no in 1995, by a very slim majority, be given an opportunity to vote a third time. Oddly enough, even if the no side won with only 50.4% of the votes in 1995, they seem to think that the question was clear enough.\n\nOn that basis, we must conclude that the moral contract, if I can put it that way, that had been agreed to between Quebecers and the federal governments of 1980 and 1995 was broken. This fully justifies the holding of a third referendum, so that we can tell Quebecers “Listen, they told you that they would reform a number of things to convince you to vote no. Well, there was no reform whatsoever. Do you still think we should continue to be part of that country?”\n\nI believe that if Quebecers were to say no, they would have the option and the freedom to leave this country.\n\nWith all due respect for my hon. colleague from Halifax West who has worked very hard to prepare this bill, I want to say that although I understand why he felt the need to introduce this legislation, we will unfortunately be unable to support his bill.\n\nWe cannot support a bill that establishes a code of conduct for parliamentarians when it seems that there is already a very mysterious code of conduct for the ministers that is, however, known only to the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Prime Minister appointed an ethics counsellor who reports only to the Prime Minister on a code of conduct known only to the Prime Minister, and now we are asked to set stricter rules for parliamentarians than the ones being applied to cabinet members who have access to inside information and subsidy programs.\n\nI submit to all my colleagues in the House, and with all due respect to our colleague from Halifax West, that the priority should have been the adoption of a public code of conduct for cabinet members. After that, it would be possible to consider adopting a code of conduct for parliamentarians.\n\nIf it is appropriate to consider the adoption of a code of conduct for cabinet members and perhaps for parliamentarians, we must also examine the source of certain conflicts of interest in which parliamentarians but especially cabinet members have found themselves or could find themselves.\n\nWhen one looks at the various cases of conflict of interest over the years, it is possible to see a direct relation between businesses that made contributions to campaign funds and services rendered by parliamentarians, ministers and government members afterwards.\n\nIn closing, I think we must not only look at adopting codes of conduct, but we must also carefully examine the way in which political parties get their funding. Bill C-2 will give us the opportunity to discuss this fundamental issue.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and address this item of Private Members' Business this afternoon dealing with the creation of a code of conduct.\n\nThe development of a code of conduct for members of parliament is a proposal that has been brought before the House many times over the past 20 years or so. In fact, my hon. colleague introduced this bill in the last session of parliament, which was Bill C-488.\n\nA code of conduct is a matter in which all parliamentarians have an interest and which can only be implemented with the agreement of all members of parliament and in the other place. Obviously, every parliamentarian has a responsibility to act with honesty and integrity and to maintain the confidence that Canadians have placed in all of us.\n\nThe Prime Minister, himself, in this House has said:\n\n—trust in the institutions of government is not a partisan issue, but something all of us elected to public office have an obligation to restore.\n\nClearly as parliamentarians we have individual responsibility for ethical conduct. In addition, together we have a collective responsibility to ensure that conduct. In part, this is because the legislature is a separate and distinct branch of government from the executive. Our approach to conduct can only properly be developed by us for ourselves.\n\nMy hon. colleague's initiative for a code of conduct raises issues regarding our individual and collective responsibilities here in parliament.\n\nTo put this in perspective, I will comment on what is already in place and the work that has gone on before us as it relates to the integrity and honesty of our political institutions.\n\nFirst, as parliamentarians we are already governed by the laws of the country, as well as the laws of parliament.\n\nLet me begin with the standing orders of the House of Commons, which govern us here, and the rich history of precedents and Speakers' rulings, which establish parameters for the carriage of our duties as parliamentarians. The same applies in the other place with their own rules.\n\nFor example, Standing Order 21 provides that members cannot vote on a question in which they may have a pecuniary interest. Standing Order 23 defines as a high crime and misdemeanour the act of members of the House accepting money to promote a matter which is being considered by parliament.\n\nThe criminal code specifically prohibits members of parliament from engaging in bribery and corrupt acts. However, the courts have recognized some ambiguity in the definition of the term officer of parliament, and it has been suggested that the term should be clarified by parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Canada Act addresses conflict of interest for senators and establishes fines for contravention. There are also provisions relating to contracting governing members of the House, though it has also been proposed that these rules, long standing, now be updated.\n\nThe Elections Act also sets out guidelines for conduct during elections, for example, with respect to campaign financing. An amendment to the Elections Act currently before the House increases the level of transparency and accountability in election financing, which is consistent with the government's commitment to restore integrity to our political institutions. The penalty in some cases under the Elections Act is loss of the member's seat.\n\nAside from these basic building blocks for ethical behaviour, from the beginning the government has recognized the importance of restoring the appearances of honesty and integrity to the country's political institutions. We set this out as a top priority in our Liberal Party's red book during the 1993 election.\n\nSince then, the list of initiatives we have implemented is quite long, but I am sure my colleagues will recognize the following. The government introduced amendments to the Lobbyists Registration Act to increase the transparency of lobbying activities. This included stiffer penalties for lobbyists, and has increased the transparency of their activities.\n\nAs part of this initiative, the government also appointed an ethics counsellor who has responsibilities in two areas: First, he advises ministers and government officials on their conduct in the course of carrying out their official duties; and second, the ethics counsellor can investigate complaints about lobbyists' activities pursuant to their code of conduct.\n\nThe Prime Minister tabled a new conflict of interest code for public office holders in the House in June 1994. This code is a concrete measure that shows that the government recognizes that restoring the public trust involves strengthening the system from both the public office and lobbying sides.\n\nThe code sets out key principles that apply to all public office holders: ministers, secretaries of state, parliamentary secretaries, ministerial staff and full time governor in council appointees. The code is enforced by the Prime Minister.\n\nAs we can see, the government takes very seriously its responsibilities to maintain integrity in government.\n\nI will now address parliament's efforts in developing a code of conduct. We have been studying the issue of parliamentary ethics since the early 1970s with various government green papers, standing committee reports and a plethora of bills on the subject, although all have died on the order paper.\n\nIn fact, some of the most in depth study was conducted quite recently. Here I am thinking of the work of the special joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on a code of conduct, which was established by the government in 1995.\n\nThis committee, which was chaired by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, heard from many witnesses, including the federal ethics counsellor, the privacy commissioner, academics in the field of political science, respected members of the public and several provincial commissioners of ethics.\n\nThe final report of that committee constructed a code that drew on many of the common elements raised during testimony. Some examples include: that a list of principles should be included in the code: that it was important to have a commissioner or body appointed to provide advice, take disclosures and enforce the code, as does the existing ethics commissioner for ministers and parliamentary secretaries; that it needed to deal with disclosure of assets and interests; the importance of clarifying the area of government contracting; and recognizing the distinction between the legislature and the executive by recommending that a permanent committee be established to administer the code.\n\nFrom reading Bill C-226, I can see that my hon. colleague opposite has drawn on much of the previous work that has been done by parliamentarians.\n\nHowever, as with the many initiatives on a code of conduct for parliamentarians, the special committee's report was not adopted because members of parliament themselves could not agree to adopt the report.\n\nSome members of parliament have indicated that in their view a formal code could create a rigid and onerous system of rules which would not be appropriate in a parliament.\n\nSo the challenge in the House and in the other place has been in deciding the best balance to ensure that there exists and appears to be ethical behaviour on the part of parliamentarians.\n\nAs I have mentioned, we already have a range of measures in place to deal with this area.\n\nI am not personally aware of a great interest among hon. members in making the development of a formal code a priority at this time. I am also not aware of a special need to do it at this time.\n\nThe member's efforts, the member who moved the bill, are most creditable and laudable. He continues a tradition that has been around this place for 20 or so years now. I certainly want to recognize his efforts and contribution to this and to our efforts collectively in this place to maintain high standards and the appearance of high standards of ethical conduct in the conduct of our work and responsibilities as parliamentarians.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to talk to the bill about a code of conduct and whether an official code of conduct is a good idea here in the House of Commons and for parliamentarians generally.\n\nI have listened with interest to the member from the government side as he talked about some of the safeguards that are in the system now to ensure that conduct is above reproach.\n\nI find this a very interesting bill. The idea that parliamentary service is a public trust is something that I think most parliamentarians hold very close to their heart. They want to do what it takes to ensure public confidence is maintained in the precincts of parliament.\n\nA code of official conduct is an idea that I think is worth debating. We have had the example of the ethics counsellor, which the member on the government side mentioned, who is selected by the Prime Minister himself but then must often investigate the actions of the Prime Minister. That brings conflict.\n\nI think the debate is very timely. It is timely because people, by and large, have a reduced standard of respect for this institution and for the members. It has been steadily declining for a long time.\n\nWhen we look at the occupations that have the respect of Canadians, we see that doctors are near the top and that social workers have a certain standing. However, as we go down the line and we get to elected officials, we see that they are way down on the respect list, and we cannot ignore that. That is why this debate is timely, and I congratulate the member for bringing it forward.\n\nThe principles of the bill involve things such as ethical standards; the way parliamentarians will act in a fashion that will promote and preserve public confidence and open themselves up to public scrutiny, the way they will arrange their private affairs so they are in the public interest, and that they will not accept any gift or personal benefit connected with their office that could reasonably be seen to compromise their judgment or integrity.\n\nI will dwell on the last point for a few minutes. In the House during question period today, I brought up the situation that has been evolving over the grants in the Prime Minister's riding. This is a good example of why we need an arm's length ethics counsellor, an arm's length code of conduct. I would like to see what the ethics counsellor believes in because I have never been able to get a copy of what he is trying to enforce.\n\nWhat we asked in question period today is an example of why we need to have public scrutiny and openness about the actions of both ministers and parliamentarians. We asked how many coincidences in a row it takes before the alarm bells go off regarding the activities of the Prime Minister and these government grants.\n\nI can detail, for example, that in the 1997 campaign, 33% of the total of the personal and business donations to the Prime Minister's personal campaign had some government grant or government loan association to it. In other words, the person or the company that received a federal government loan or grant gave in return large donations to the Prime Minister ranging from as low as $400 to as high as $10,000. That in and of itself is not evidence of any wrongdoing, but it goes on.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister sold property to someone who had, shall we say, dubious business credentials and had gone broke in a previous hotel business, the Prime Minister sold a hotel to the same person. That person then received more government grants. Did the Prime Minister receive a benefit or not? The ethics counsellor said that he did not really think so, but that same hotel now owes taxes to the provincial government and the local Shawinigan government. It owes federal excise taxes and $100,000 to the local contractors. The inn is now up for sale again.\n\nWhy did that hotel ever get any federal money in grants and loans given the bad track record of the proprietor and the very close connection to the Prime Minister? Maybe that in and of itself is not enough to cause alarm bells, although I would argue that they are starting to jingle a little bit. It goes on from there.\n\nRené Fugère was an unpaid aide to the Prime Minister. He represented the Prime Minister at public functions and made announcements on behalf of the Prime Minister here and there. He was closely tied to the Prime Minister. This was someone who represented the Prime Minister at constituency functions. He announced a transitional jobs fund grant for the Grand-Mère Inn in the Prime Minister's riding. Ten days later, he received $11,500 from that same company for services. Maybe it is a happy coincidence for this fellow. If the bells were jingling before, now they are starting to get a little nervous because there are so many coincidences. On and on it goes.\n\nThe human resources minister has a special fund that is available for special grants only at the minister's discretion. The only grant that is given out in all of Canada goes into the Prime Minister's riding. Maybe that is another one of those coincidences, but what happens is that the grant is not spent so they have to set up a special trust fund to keep that grant money in the riding until the next fiscal year.\n\nBy the government's own admission, by the admission of the government's own documents, the trouble is that the trust fund is actually illegal. It is outside the parameters of legality. They cannot do it legally but it is set up anyway.\n\nIt is illegal. It is one of a kind. It is in the Prime Minister's riding. It follows all these other things. Maybe it is a happy coincidence. More than that, the lawyer who set up the illegal trust fund was appointed not once but twice by the Prime Minister to his role at Canada Post, the last time being in September of this year. The alarm bells have gone off now for me. There are too many happy coincidences all at once, one after the other after the other.\n\nThe Quality Inn in the Prime Minister's riding, for example, received a $600,000 grant. It was announced without any departmental paperwork. No paperwork was done whatsoever. It was advertized in the Prime Minister's householder in April 1997, the month the election was called. The approval came well after it was announced in the householder. Press releases were made. There were announcements of grand things that were coming.\n\nMr. Thibault is involved, a self-confessed embezzler in the Prime Minister's riding and now the subject of criminal investigation involved in legal disputes in the riding. One of the fundraisers for the Liberal Party of Canada in the last election has been convicted of influence peddling by linking the transitional jobs funds grants by saying that he will arrange a grant or arrange for someone to see the minister but the person will have to give a donation to the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party does not condone this but it happened. He has been convicted of it.\n\nWhen I look at a bill like this one I am not sure it would prevent that. It would certainly point to how wrong it is. It would say that we have to conduct our affairs so that we can be seen to be at arm's length from any benefit to ourselves politically or from any benefit from any sale of property. We have to conduct ourselves in a way that brings honour to this place.\n\nI have asked the Prime Minister repeatedly to table in the House all documents associated with this matter. We keep digging them up in access to information requests. We had some more today. We will have some more tomorrow. The Liberals can know that now.\n\nThe problem is that it is time everyone understands that an ethics councillor in this place needs to be arm's length from everyone, including the Prime Minister, to give reports to all of us in order to uphold the highest standard of public conduct and to establish faith in a very honoured institution.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak this evening to the bill of the hon. member for Halifax West which seeks to establish a code of conduct for parliamentarians, a code of ethics for parliamentarians. I think that is very important.\n\nI believe the member makes a valid point with this piece of legislation. There are countless examples of elected politicians who dangerously straddle the fence between what is right and wrong in terms of conduct.\n\nFor example, the Prime Minister and his suspect use of the transitional jobs fund has led to repeated stories in the press about large federal grants going to shady businessmen in the Prime Minister's riding. In an instance like this one where there is even a political staffer being quoted in the newspaper as saying the process for doling out cash in Shawinigan was outside the standard practices of the Department of Human Resources Development, one has to wonder if an appropriate watchdog body's time is not due.\n\nThere is a big difference between sending everything through the criminal route and being investigated by the RCMP versus it being investigated by an independent body that would go after the conduct or the ethics of how a person behaves.\n\nThe Minister for International Trade, who has taken some serious criticism for his election fundraising and his use of the transitional jobs fund, is another example where a committee or body overseeing ethics might be a good idea. I do not think we need to set up witch-hunt committees. I do not think this is the point of the hon. member's bill. However, in a case like this one where the minister's practices are in question an ethics committee would be a logical tool in establishing the realities of the situation.\n\nThe Minister of Human Resources Development, who has also made fine use of the TJF for propping up projects in her riding, might be in a situation where a committee would be a wise body in straightening out the issue.\n\nThrough all the endless stories of the government's questionable approach to using public funds, the government repeatedly tells us and Canadians that all is okay with this behaviour because the ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, acts as a watchdog for the Prime Minister and cabinet.\n\nMr. Wilson is not really an ethics counsellor. He is a staffer who reports to the Prime Minister. If he hears of any unfavourable conduct, his job is to straighten it out with the ministers and the Prime Minister and cover it up. A true ethics counsellor would look at it and if there were any inappropriateness his role would be to tell parliament or a committee of parliament. His role would also be to make it public.\n\nWhile this position provides lovely optics for the government, the fact remains that he reports to the Prime Minister. He does not report to the House but to the individual whom he is supposed to monitor. This is absurd and completely counterproductive to the whole notion of having an ethics watchdog. What is the purpose of having somebody policing his boss? The position despite the charming title is a political one where an individual is tasked with keeping the Prime Minister and ministers out of trouble.\n\nThere is a need for an individual who reports to the House on the ethics of government. However I am not sure it is necessary to monitor every member of the House of Commons and the Senate. By the simple virtue of being elected by the citizens of Canada we are automatically asked and expected to hold a high standard of conduct.\n\nHowever, if we were to look into it further, the U.S. House of Representatives model may be worth examining. Its committee on house administration is charged with overseeing and, if warranted, examining the ethical behaviour of congressmen. This might be a good approach to look at rather than the existing ethics counsellor who is really nothing more than a political fixer for the Prime Minister and his ministers.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, first I want to express my deep appreciation to all members who took part in the debate. This is a very important topic, and members' opinions are very useful.\n\nI want to take a moment to try to summarize a few points that were raised with respect to the bill. My hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois had some reservations about the bill because he felt it created stricter rules for members than it did for ministers.\n\nIn all due respect to the hon. member I would say the bill does just the opposite. The bill would apply to all members including ministers and the Prime Minister. There would be baseline rules for everybody. If the Prime Minister wants to create stricter rules under the bill for his cabinet members for whatever reason he could do so, but the bill would apply to all members of parliament including members of the Senate. It would accomplish the purpose about which my hon. colleague has some concerns.\n\nWith respect to the comments made by the hon. government member regarding all measures that are currently in place, I guess the very fact that this issue keeps coming forth, as he indicated over and over again, indicates that perhaps all measures in place are not working the way they should, or else the issue would not constantly keep coming up. As he indicated I certainly did research the previous studies and the previous efforts that were made. The bill builds upon them and tries to codify and bring together all the loose pieces under a workable piece of legislation.\n\nWith respect to the hon. member's comments he mentioned that the Right Hon. Prime Minister said that ethics should not be a partisan issue. This is exactly why the bill has come forward. It is not a partisan issue. It is an issue that would apply to all members regardless of political stripe, regardless of whether or not they hold office. The system in place is open to suspect in terms of the ethics counsellor who currently reports to the Prime Minister and does not have in the real sense any objectivity in terms of reporting to parliament as a whole. Therefore there is even within the current structure a system that allows for a perceived conflict of interest.\n\nI am sure all hon. members would believe and understand that even if something is being done correctly there is no harm in having it looked at because that removes any air of suspicion the public may have with respect to actions by elected members. The bill would certainly enhance the role of parliamentarians and would provide for transparency.\n\nI have already expressed my disappointment that the bill was not made votable. I recall someone saying that I should not expect it to be made votable because nobody would really want to vote against it; it would be like voting against motherhood. I understand that, but it is time we voted for motherhood and stood up for something that would perhaps help us improve the way this institution operates on behalf of Canadians.\n\nI did not get a degree of confidence from the people to whom I spoke as I was campaigning and still speak to. They do not have any great degree of confidence in the House and in the personal ethics of everyone in the House and the way we operate. As a matter of fact I think we are rated close to the bottom of the pile on the list of professions. We are down with used car salesmen, I believe.\n\nAnything we can do to improve the image of parliamentarians would be helpful. I understand why the hon. member on the government side would not want to see the bill come into play because it certainly places an additional onus upon us.\n\nI agree with one opinion expressed by the hon. member on the government side. We cannot legislate behaviour and ethics. Ultimately the law that has to apply to all of us is the law of love that comes from within and comes from the heart. I honestly urge all of us, regardless of what legislation is on the books, to examine our actions from within and continue to strive on behalf of those whom we represent from a point of view of love, integrity and respect for other people.\n\nI was speaking with a grade five class in Basinview school in my riding the other day. It struck me that these young people were very much interested in the parliamentary system. I stressed to them the most important thing of all, that no matter what occupation they pursue they should do it with honesty, integrity and a sense of transparency and respect for other people.\n\nAs we draw close to the Christmas season I wish all my colleagues a very, very merry Christmas, happy new year, happy holiday season, and all the best in the upcoming millennium.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise on a question that I first raised on November 23. It was a general question about aircraft in the Department of National Defence.\n\nWe talked about Hercules planes that could not get off the ground and could not make it from point A to point B. We talked about the Auroras which cannot fly too low and cannot fly too high. There is only one elevation they can fly at.\n\nI would like to hone in on the Sea King question today. We all know the Sea Kings are very tired and old. They have been refurbished. They have new skins and now they have new lives but even with that, the minister of defence says that their useful life is only until 2005 before we get new helicopters to replace them.\n\nWe know that new helicopters are necessary now, especially because we have spent all this money on frigates that were designed to have these new helicopters. Without the helicopters they are really only about 50% effective. We are most anxious to see those helicopters supplied, but the problem is the new helicopter delivery time is eight years. The Sea Kings only have a useful life until 2005 and if we ordered the helicopters today, which we have not done yet, they would not be here until 2008. There is a hole between 2005 and 2008.\n\nMy question for the parliamentary secretary is, what will the department of defence do in the time period between the earliest delivery date of 2008 and the expiry of useful life of the Sea Kings in 2005? What happens in the three year hole?",

Every day Canadian forces aircraft operate throughout the country and around the world performing a variety of demanding missions.\n\nDuring their mission in East Timor, our Hercules aircraft completed some 130 operational missions carrying more than two million pounds of equipment and some 2,200 personnel. They have also airlifted humanitarian aid to various regions of the world. Canadians also appreciated the valuable contributions of the Hercules during the Manitoba flood and the great ice storm.\n\nOur Labrador helicopters continue to conduct dangerous search and rescue operations and save thousands of lives every year. They will soon be replaced with state of the art Cormorant helicopters.\n\nDuring the recent NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, the CF-18s flew more than 670 sorties striking at a variety of military targets.\n\nIn the last few years the government has also taken significant steps to ensure the air force has the tools it needs to do its job. In addition to the Cormorant, the minister has announced the beginning of modernization of programs for both the Aurora maritime patrol aircraft and the CF-18 aircraft.\n\nI am also very pleased to report that the Auroras, which until mid-November were restricted to unpressurized flights, are now almost all authorized to fly at a new altitude of over 10,000 feet. This comes after detailed inspections confirming that these planes can carry out pressurized flights in complete safety.\n\nAs for the Sea Kings, the minister has made it very clear, on more than one occasion, that they need to be replaced. In fact, the minister confirmed several times in the House that new maritime helicopters were the number one equipment priority. We are therefore in the process of developing an acquisition strategy.\n\nThese initiatives will help ensure that Canada's airforce can continue to serve all Canadians from one end of the country to the other and will make it possible to continue to interoperate effectively with our allies.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I was appalled at the President of the Treasury Board's response to my question concerning racism in society at large, and in the federal government in particular. She had a choice. On behalf of the government, she could have addressed issues of racial discrimination. Instead she chose to play partisan political games, but it gets worse. She then proceeded to say that the government is addressing the problem by setting up an advisory board.\n\nBlack Canadians and other visible minorities have been studied to death. What we need are solutions. The Canadian Human Rights Commission's analysis of the government's performance in 1998 shows an abysmal record. Out of 12,420 term staff positions filled last year, only 418 were visible minorities. That is only 3%. Out of 2,800 permanent jobs filled, only 184 were visible minorities, but with 685 visible minority positions lost, the Liberals had a net loss of 501 employees, or a decrease of 18%.\n\nI am sure the government is well aware that it has been over two years since the commission released the study carried out by Dr. John Samuel entitled “Visible Minorities and the Public Service”. In February 1998 a forum on racial discrimination in the federal public service and federal agencies in Canada looked at the issues of systemic racism.\n\nThe Canadian Human Rights Commission states in its 1998 annual report:\n\nThe public service's record regarding the employment of visible minorities is worse than its record for the other designated groups. For 1997-98, the representation of visible minorities was 5.1 per cent, about half of what could be expected based on the number of people qualified and available for work. There were ample opportunities to remedy this situation, since more than 15,000 people were hired, but the number of visible minority candidates recruited was less than half of those qualified and available. Given the continuing difficulties that federal government departments seem to be experiencing in hiring and promoting visible minorities, it is hard to conclude that they have taken to heart the recommendations made by Dr. Samuel.\n\nI also raised in my question to the President of the Treasury Board the government's inexcusable act of failing to appoint Judge Corrine Sparks who was passed over and ignored in a conscious decision by the government to appoint judges who have sat on the bench in Nova Scotia for less time. Judge Sparks was appointed in 1987. The government overlooked her in favour of judges appointed in 1995, 1993 and 1991, among others. As Lincoln Alexander, chairperson of the Canada Race Relations Foundation stated, this is a “major slap in the face to the black community” and he suggested the government's actions “smack of racism”.\n\nI first raised the issue in the House of Commons on April 14. The government buried its head in the sand and hoped the problem would go away, as governments in the country have so often hoped when it comes to issues of fairness for blacks and other Canadians of colour.\n\nThe figures speak for themselves. Representation of Canada's visible minority population in the government's public service is abysmal and offensive.\n\nI sincerely hope the government representative will not respond with platitudes, with comments of look how well they have done, and with vague references to future reports of advisory boards or task forces.\n\nI hope the Liberal government will now respond with an action plan including targets, funding and dates.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, why does the government put gun registration ahead of putting more police on the streets? This policy of the government has negatively affected my riding of Dauphin—Swan River.\n\nIf safe streets are a priority of the Prime Minister, then the government is spending in the wrong places. Let us look at some facts.\n\nHundreds and hundreds of RCMP positions remain unfilled throughout the country. There are 39 RCMP positions vacant right now in Manitoba. The RCMP training depot in Regina is currently closed. The new government estimates show the spending of $35 million for gun control and only $13.8 million for the RCMP. Where are the priorities of the government?\n\nCanada has had gun control for over 60 years. No one disputes that need. Wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on a wasteful long gun registry is irresponsible. This money would be better used to put more police officers on the street, or used in health and education or in defence.\n\nI want to read for the record some information obtained through access to information by my colleague the member for Yorkton—Melville on the current registry of long firearms in this country.\n\nThe registration system has cost more than $300 million so far. Only $2.9 million in user fees were collected in the last six months of operation. Justice department has still not released the registry's budget for this fiscal year. Cabinet secrecy was used to hide 172 pages of documents on true costs of gun registry. On bureaucrats, as many as 800 paper pushers are now working on the firearms registration scheme. The RCMP have diverted resources from law enforcement to employ 391 on the firearms registry.\n\nStatistics Canada reports that 98% of violent crime victims never encounter firearms. Forty-six percent of all murders are committed with handguns despite a 65 year old handgun registry. Criminal incidents have doubled since 1970 but the number of police officers per capita is dropping.\n\nThe RCMP report less than 10% compliance. What use will this be to police? Backlogs are increasing despite a 70% lower than expected number of applications.\n\nA consultants' report states that workflow is inflexible and inefficient at the registry. Only 87,825 photo IDs were issued in the first year of operation; only 2.5 million to 6.5 million to go. Only 260,464 registration certificate numbers have been issued; only six million to 20 million to go. The minister's firearms experts say production must increase from 1,500 per day to 13,500 per day.\n\nOn the economic impact, cabinet secrecy was used to hide a 115 page report on the economic impact of the registry. There are still legal challenges ahead. Six provinces and two territories are challenging the registry in the supreme court.\n\nIn closing, the government is making the streets of Canada less safe through the headstrong drive to register all long guns in this country. When will the government wake up, quit playing politics and fund the RCMP properly instead of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on useless long gun registration?",

I would like to assure my colleague that contrary to the opinion of some here, this new program is making a real difference, a difference we can measure.\n\nFirst, it is making a real difference in terms of public safety. The objective of the firearms legislation is to create a culture of safety regarding firearms in Canada and to keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them. Looking over the record of the past year, we can plainly see that the program is doing just that.\n\nStricter eligibility checks on licence holders and applicants is one piece of evidence. Officials have refused 587 new applications for public safety reasons and have revoked 504 licences to individuals who no longer meet the eligibility requirements. This number is significant. It is seven times higher than the total for the past five years. It is a measurement of the success of a new system that provides more information in a timely manner to public safety authorities.\n\nThe checking system is also successful in uncovering cases of licence falsification, unauthorized sale of firearms and spousal abuse.\n\nSecond, the program is making a difference in terms of what it offers police. The program has provided police services with concrete savings. In fact, there is an annual saving of $30 million because officers no longer have to do the paperwork of accepting applications and issuing licences. This allows police more time to do policing. It certainly does not take police off the streets and it does not reduce municipal, provincial or RCMP police budgets. In fact, the federal government reimburses provinces and other administrators of the system for the work they do in the firearms program.\n\nThen there is the fact that the registry provides vital information to police, information that is invaluable to criminal investigations. It enables police to take preventive measures when responding to emergency calls and to identify guns held illegally.\n\nIn fact, Canadians should be proud of the country's firearms legislation. This legislation will make our communities safer. It is unfortunate that the Reform Party refuses to see this fact.",
