The Canada Elections Act constitutes the operational basis of our democratic electoral system. Our elections act is based on three essential principles: equity, transparency and accessibility.\n\nFor close to 30 years now, the Canada Elections Act has been the focal point of an electoral system that has been an inspiration to democracies the world over. Our Elections Act is based on solid principles and orientations. Nevertheless, administrative inconsistencies have developed over those 30 years, and we need to eliminate them and to amend sections of the Act the courts have chosen to strike down.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for preparing the excellent report on which this legislation is based, particularly the hon. member for Peterborough who chaired its work.\n\nThe amendments we propose today are based on the committee's findings and recommendations. The bill also reflects the recommendations contained in the 1991 report of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform, the Lortie Commission, the proposals submitted in 1993 by the special House committee, and the Chief Electoral Officer's reports to parliament in 1996 and 1997.\n\nAs well, the bill reflects discussions between myself and my counterparts in the United Kingdom, as well as the ideas, concerns and initiatives shared with us by large numbers of MPs, senators, members of all political parties, academics, interest groups and ordinary citizens.\n\nOur government is determined to see this bill passed and to implement amendments which reflect the wisdom and collective vision of the hon. members.\n\nReference to a committee before second reading will permit broader amendments, provided of course that these amendments amend the same statute as is the subject of the bill. Allow me to take some time to describe some of the administrative changes proposed in this bill.\n\nWe have proposed that the chief electoral officer be empowered to adjust voting hours for areas that do not switch to daylight saving time. This will address the problem Saskatchewan voters experienced in the last election.\n\nWe are also offsetting the impact of inflation since the act was introduced in 1974, increasing the threshold for the disclosure of the names and addresses of campaign contributors for donations and the threshold for receiving the 75% political tax credit from $100 to $200. The voucher expense limit would be increased from $25 to $50. The audit fee expense limit, because it is getting very difficult to hire auditors for $750, would be increased to $1,500.\n\nWe have proposed extending voting rights to all returning officers in Canada. We have included amendments to ensure the right to campaign canvassing and the posting of signs in apartment buildings. We have proposed that the enforcement capabilities of the commissioner of Canada elections be strengthened.\n\nIn recent years, court decisions have called on the Government of Canada to take a second look at some sections of the Canada Elections Act. We believe that amendments in this legislation are consistent with both the spirit and the letter of those decisions. Our amendments regarding third party spending are a perfect case in point.\n\nWe looked closely at the 1996 decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal which threw out the previous spending limits, but we also examined the 1997 Libman decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which said:\n\nWith respect...we cannot accept the Alberta Court of Appeal's point of view because we disagree with its conclusion regarding the legitimacy of the objective of the provisions.\n\nThe court further stated: “While we recognize their right”—third parties—“to participate in the electoral process, independent individuals and groups cannot be subject to the same financial rules as candidates or political parties and be allowed the same spending limits. Although what they have to say is important, it is the candidates and political parties that are running for election. Limits on independent spending must therefore be lower than those imposed on candidates or political parties”.\n\nWe have also placed fairness at the heart of the proposed changes to the rules governing blackouts. Recently the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the 72 hour election blackout on election polls. However, the court did not close the door on giving voters the means and the time to assess polls. Consistent with the guidance of the court, we have required publication of polling methodologies and we have shortened the blackout period.\n\nWe have also addressed the issue of blackouts on political advertising. As a result of the decision of the Alberta courts, political parties now remain subject to blackouts on advertising while at the same time there is no such blackout on candidates and third parties. Obviously it is wrong and the same rule should apply to everyone.\n\nWe have proposed a new 48 hour blackout period prior to election day on political ads; no ads on election day and the day before for anybody. We want to make sure that the only group to get the last word in a campaign is Canadian voters.\n\nMost recently the Figueroa decision of the Ontario court struck down another provision in the elections act under which a political party that loses its status as a registered party must deregister and liquidate all its assets and turn them over to the receiver general.\n\nWe took note of that decision and we responded by allowing third parties that fail to field the required number of candidates during an election to retain their assets subject to certain conditions. The government is however, and most members will know this, appealing that part of the court order holding that a party need only nominate two candidates to become a registered party. The government believes strongly that the existing requirements should be defended.\n\nEvery single one of the amendments proposed in the bill, the ones that we have put forward, have put the values and principles of the elections act and Canadians first. In every single case we have asked the questions that are the foundations of the Canada Elections Act. Is it fair? Does it promote accessibility? Does it keep our electoral system open and transparent? I believe that in every case the answer is yes.\n\nOf course this is going to be a non-partisan effort. I look forward to sending the bill to committee and listening to the constructive suggestions of all members of parliament that would permit us to improve the bill, providing that the amendments amend the same acts as those referred to in the bill.\n\nI urge all members of the House to join in support of the bill and to send it to committee. I believe that together we will make it such to maintain one of Canada's most important pieces of legislation as our country and our democracy moves into the 21st century.\n\nI thank hon. members for all the work they have done thus far on improving the Canada Elections Act. I look forward to appearing before the committee, answering all questions from hon. members and working together with them to make this bill better for all Canadians.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we would not get the chance right at the beginning of this debate to ask the minister a few questions. It would help clarify the issues. Even if we all had to give up a half minute of our time, it would have helped to focus the debate.\n\nThe practice of referring bills to committee prior to second reading frankly is nothing more than a way for the government to fast track legislation that it really does not want the public and the media to get a good handle on.\n\nI know that I am not allowed to use props, but we are looking at a bill that is 253 pages thick. This bill was introduced last Thursday in the House by the minister and just a few days later he wants to ram it into committee behind closed doors where the public and the media cannot see it. It is so full of objectionable stuff that he does not want anyone in the real world to catch on to what is happening.\n\nThe government House leader is denying the public and the media the opportunity to hear a meaningful debate of the extensive provisions in the bill before it goes to committee. How are the public and interested parties going to get enough information about this bill to come to committee and make meaningful comments, answer questions and suggest amendments when they are not going to know the bill is here?\n\nThe reality of the situation is that when this bill disappears later today after the vote into committee, nobody except a few special interest groups—and if they can get a few talk show hosts or media commentators to talk about it—will know it even exists. That is an absolutely appalling situation for such a comprehensive piece of legislation.\n\nIn the six years I have been in the House I have seen very few pieces of legislation that have been this thick. One of them would be the gun control bill, Bill C-68, some years ago. Look how long that bill took to move through the House. Here we have something that is going through in a flash.\n\nIf I had had the opportunity a few minutes ago, I would have asked the minister a couple of questions in connection with the Communist Party of Canada challenge to the elections act and the number of members that constitute a party. Why is it that the government House leader is so concerned that the Communist Party of Canada or the Green Party of Canada might actually have its party name on the ballot? What is the minister so afraid of that he wants to reinstate a rule that requires 50 candidates for a group to be labelled as a party? Why on earth is there anything wrong with two, three or 10 people getting together and saying they would like to be the such and such party and have their name printed on the ballot? Is the House leader so afraid of competition that he cannot stand the thought that some other credible group might actually be on the ballot?\n\nIf we look at Germany or New Zealand, both of which have mixed member proportional systems in their elections, or any other country that has a proportional element in its electoral system, there are up to 35 parties on the ballot. Yet the voters in those countries seem perfectly capable of making sensible decisions about which parties to elect and which to reject.\n\nWhy would the government House leader believe that Canadian voters are too stupid to make those same decisions? Surely when he stood there and argued that the final decision should be that of the Canadian voter, why does he not let them make that decision? Put anybody's name on the ballot, anybody who wants to apply under the rules and pay the candidate deposit. Let them put whatever name they want on the ballot and let the voters decide. I certainly believe that voters are sensible and smart enough to make that decision themselves.\n\nAnother question I would have asked the minister is in connection with patronage which riddles like a web the field operations of Elections Canada. Elections Canada has begged the government for years to remove the patronage provisions from the elections act. When Elections Canada advises third world governments and emerging democracies how to set up their electoral systems, it never recommends the system that is used here in Canada of political patronage in all of the field positions of Elections Canada.\n\nThe registered parties get to appoint returning officers, deputy returning officers and polling clerks. A whole host of people get paid positions as rewards for supporting the government or other parties. Elections Canada has begged for the right to hire and fire on merit. The government will not give it the right because it suits the government to reward political supporters.\n\nThe government House leader mentioned that he is going to give ROs the right to vote. We all know right now because of the patronage appointments that the ROs are all Liberals. I guess they must be afraid they do not have enough votes already so they have to claw in every single vote they can get.\n\nIn terms of third party spending, I heard the government House leader quote extensively from a decision of the court in Quebec because he really did not want to take any notice of the decisions in Alberta. It amuses and puzzles me that the government is prepared to ignore court decisions in B.C. that allow child pornography to run rampant. The government is quite prepared to ignore court decisions that endorse race based fisheries, but it rushes quickly to block any tiny little court decision that might diminish its advantage in elections, such as the 50 candidate rule and the third party expenses. It wants to retain the patronage. It pays lip service to democracy but its actions speak a lot louder than its words.\n\nI mentioned the size of the bill. We have already started to contact a few parties, groups and individuals who have shown interest in the bill. We have not even been able to send them copies of the bill until yesterday by courier.\n\nThe minister wants to appear before committee as early as this Thursday. How can we expect it to be reasonable for interested people in the country, who may or may not have legal training, to go through 253 pages of a complicated bill, work out the implications for their group or part of society, prepare submissions, apply to come to Ottawa and transport themselves here by Thursday or maybe next week?\n\nWhen the committee begins discussions on the timetable for the bill, I hope it will show some reasonable consideration for those outside this place who are interested and who would like to come here as witnesses and talk about the provisions in the bill. I hope the committee will have a realistic timetable that will perhaps extend into the spring of next year. I do not see why we should rush through on something as complicated as this bill.",

Those clauses deal with the registration of and reporting of parties prior to June 2000 if the bill is passed before then.\n\nWhen I read those clauses, I just wondered if some sort of quick election was being planned and the government wants to make sure that certain things are in place by June of next year. It is interesting that my colleague mentioned that. I am not sure if he read those clauses but that was certainly there.\n\nEven the debate we are having this morning is an affront to democracy. The House leader stood and talked about the democratic process and how he supports it. However the debate we are having now is an affront to democracy. We do not get to ask any questions of any speaker on the government side. We get the opportunity to put up four people, 10 minutes each, no questions and comments, have a vote that the government side will win and it is rammed into committee.\n\nWe have all been here long enough to know exactly what will happen behind closed doors. We are all adults. The bill will be rammed through clause by clause with no meaningful input. It will be back here in the House again in its final form. That is just not good enough.\n\nI would urge the minister, if he truly believes in what he said this morning, to permit the bill to have a thorough investigation in committee and to permit meaningful amendments. The one which I will propose will surely not be too controversial. It is simply to build in the opportunity for the chief electoral officer to investigate and experiment with electronic voting. Since that has been in the Elections Act in Ontario for three years there is no reason it should not be in the federal act.\n\nI look forward to being in committee. I also look forward to a meaningful debate once the bill is back in the House.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to take part in the preliminary debate on Bill C-2, an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons, repealing other acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts.\n\nI would like to point out that, in preparation for this bill, no fewer than 14 sittings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs were spent considering the present Canada Elections Act during this parliament.\n\nGiven our detailed and careful study, we were entitled to expect that the government would pay particular attention to the various recommendations formulated by the standing committee, but this did not seem to be entirely the case.\n\nCertain unanimous recommendations of the committee are nowhere to be found in the bill. I will come back to this a little later in my speech.\n\nTo begin with, when we considered the Canada Elections Act, I was struck by two things in particular: funding of political parties, and the corollary issue of trust funds established to support candidates. No less important, I would say that the partisan process for appointing electoral officers also leaves me confused.\n\nUnder the Canada Elections Act, small and large corporations have always been able to contribute to the funding of federal political parties. This practice allows the various parties to amass huge sums, while making it less necessary to approach individual voters for money.\n\nAs they do not have to keep to a contribution limit, corporations may contribute huge sums to the federal political parties of their choice, and, need I point out, these contributions certainly do not go to political parties for purely philanthropic purposes.\n\nThe funding of political parties, as practised federally, necessarily implies preferential treatment for the most generous, and God knows just how generous they can be under the law.\n\nI simply want to say that, with a simple contribution of a few dollars, the ordinary voter runs the risk of not having the ear of his political representatives to the same extent as a bank, which, for example, may make substantial contributions of up to several tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe situation creates different categories of contributors, and, unfortunately, different levels of attention to the many requests and expectations political leaders must address.\n\nToday, we are considering a bill, which, according to the government, aims at, and I quote: “equity, transparency and accessibility”. I might question that. How can the government claim that this process is equitable, when the provisions of the bill do not establish any sort of limit for contributions?\n\nWho could claim, without raising an eyebrow, that this system is truly equitable, transparent and accessible, a system that allows corporations, which do not have the right to vote, to meddle in the electoral process by making contributions far beyond the capability of the ordinary voter, and thus unduly influencing the political policy of the parties and the candidates seeking votes?\n\nThis bill runs counter to a narrow concept of the rules of democracy that should govern our society, since it still gives its wealthier members a more attentive ear and a greater voice with those representing the public.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, having a trust fund to support candidates seems to be nebulous at the very least. Another financial matter, you will say. This point was unanimously recommended by the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs when the federal electoral legislation was studied.\n\nThe members of the committee wanted the government to clarify the rules governing this practice, which may make it possible to circumvent the already lax provisions of the election act on funding of political parties. Well, not a word; nothing we recommended on the subject appears in the bill we are now considering.\n\nSo what is the point of in depth examination in preparation for bills such as this one, if the government merely nods and takes from our deliberations only those elements that suit it and which it had already in all likelihood decided to legislate?\n\nDoes this mean that the work and recommendations of the committees are only recognized and implemented when they meet cabinet's expectations?\n\nLarge amounts of money may be deposited through trust funds in the election fund of a candidate, with no one being able to identify the source of that money. This directly contravenes the spirit and even the letter of the Canada Elections Act. Monitoring, through a legislative framework, the source of a candidate's trust funds would definitely have added greater transparency to the electoral system, to use a term so dear to this government. But the Liberals decided not to endorse that recommendation and one wonders why.\n\nI will now address the appointment process of electoral officers, which is another example of transparency that is opaque, to say the least.\n\nHow can the government claim to have a transparent electoral process when returning officers are all appointed by the governor in council, that is by the party in office?\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois can only deplore the partisan nature of these appointments, something which is unacceptable in a process as democratic as an election.\n\nThe government preferred to keep this eminently partisan instrument, which it can use to its advantage, instead of leaving the electoral process in the hands of qualified, non-partisan and objective people. Can one truly believe that a returning officer appointed by the party in office will be unbiased? I have doubts about that in many cases. And what about the provisions dealing with third party interventions, which set a spending limit only for costs related to advertising?\n\nWhen it considered issues such as the ones I mentioned earlier, my party came to the conclusion that the expressions “reform” and “in-depth review of the elections act” were somewhat exaggerated. It has been over 30 years since the Canada Elections Act last underwent any serious overhaul. The government claims to have put forth the so-called principles of equity, transparency and accessibility, when in fact it did nothing more than indulge in a primarily self-serving exercise at the expense of the voters that it should be serving.\n\nGovernment members missed a good opportunity to demonstrate that they really had democratization of the electoral process at heart. It seemed to those of us in the Bloc Quebecois that, after thirty years of elections under this legislation, a serious reform could, and should, be undertaken. Having experienced, in this last year of the millennium, the Liberal regime and its twenty-five gags imposed in the first session of the 36th Parliament alone, it would be daydreaming o believe that the government truly intended to carry out any real modernization of the electoral system.\n\nI will take this opportunity to express the wish that, despite the somewhat singular character of the legislative process in which we are currently engaged in order to pass bill C-2, the government will truly pay attention to the concerns expressed by the witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, that it will be open to proposed amendments it might receive from the various parties in this House, and that it will be prepared to truly make this process, this operation to revise the federal election legislation, a process devoted to truly democratizing the electoral system in Canada.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-2 which is the first major overhaul of the Canada Elections Act since 1970. MPs are very interested in the minute details of the bill because it is one of the key rule books for the sport of politics and the business of politics.\n\nI will put the bill's importance into some kind of context. The biggest single difference between Canadian rules in elections and U.S. rules in elections is the fact that we have reasonable campaign spending limits in Canada. In the U.S. spending limits are stratospheric. One does not have to be a billionaire like Donald Trump, Ross Perot, Steven Forbes or Oprah Winfrey to run an election campaign in Canada as one would have to be in the U.S. We do not have to spend most of our time as elected members of parliament sucking up to the political action committees of various lobby groups that have the power to raise money for our campaigns or to spend millions of dollars to defeat us over some narrow issue.\n\nIt is true that we are seeing a few Americanisms entering our process on a small scale. If the National Citizens' Coalition and the Reform Party had their way we would have even more. They want American style health care and American style politics to help them get it.\n\nLet us be proud of the following point. It cost Barbara Boxer $22 million U.S. to win her senate seat in California. That amount and more will be spent by both Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani as they run for the vacant New York senate seat.\n\nIn comparison, I just received a letter from the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada saying that the spending limit in my riding for the next election will be around $61,000. With a few more golf tournaments and potluck suppers by the hundreds of supporters we have in my district we can raise that money easily over a four year period.\n\nWe have these spending limits in part because David Lewis and the NDP were foresighted enough make them part of their price for supporting the minority Liberal government in 1974.\n\nU.S. style campaign financing makes running for office an impossibility for ordinary citizens like most of us in the House. It turns election volunteers into full time, paid professionals, running round-the-clock, round-the-calendar election campaigns. It reduces interest groups and social movements to buying and selling votes instead of trying to influence public policy with the strength of their research and the moral weight of their arguments.\n\nOne benchmark to assess change in the elections act should be whether a certain provision helps more ordinary citizens get involved in the electoral system. Then it is worthy of support.\n\nAnother benchmark is if the provision encourages us to concentrate in the public interest and the public good, rather than endless fundraising from special interests. Then it is worthy of our support.\n\nThere are many changes in the act that the NDP supports. We support the national riding limits on third party advertising and the requirement to identify their sponsors. We believe uncontrolled advertising would distort elections in favour of those groups which can afford million dollar ad campaigns at the expense of democracy. Without this clause we would have the U.S. style financing to which I referred.\n\nWe also support polling blackouts during the last 48 hours of the campaign. Poll results are capable of being manipulated and the parties involved need to be given sufficient time to respond to published findings so the public can get the whole story.\n\nWe support changing the voting hours in Saskatchewan. I guess folks in central Canada who never heard of my province do not know that we observe only central standard time throughout the year, but at least now we will not be voting later than B.C. as we did in the last federal election campaign.\n\nWe support the changes which do not automatically deregister parties and thereby force the sale of assets if that political party for one election could not muster a slate of at least 50 candidates.\n\nWe strongly support the increases in the federal political contribution tax credit limits for individuals. This is an inclusionary policy. It involves more people and is the first change since the NDP obtained these credits as part of a package to democratize election financing in Canada back in 1974, fully 25 years ago.\n\nAnother positive change is the fact that all candidates are now eligible for the return of the $1,000 nomination deposit once the appropriate election expense returns are filed with Elections Canada. Previously candidates needed to get 15% of the vote or they would lose their deposit.\n\nOfficial agents can be fired and replaced if necessary during a campaign and nomination papers can now be filed electronically or by fax. My colleagues from Yukon, Churchill River, Saskatchewan and Churchill, Manitoba will certainly appreciate this change as their ridings are bigger than most European countries. Of course they do not have the roads to match, at least not until we have a national highway program.\n\nFor our urban friends, the right of access for candidates and their volunteers to campaign in condos and apartments is strengthened.\n\nWe also support the changes which make it administratively easier for political parties to merge. Unfortunately, for the Leader of the Opposition, it cannot be made politically any easier for him, at least not in this piece of legislation.\n\nHowever, there are two changes which we oppose, and there are some glaring omissions. We cannot support the elimination of so-called “rural vouching”. People who live in the city often do not know their neighbours. We know that. However, folks who live in the country all know one another. They grew up together, went to school together, farm together, do business together and are usually related to one another.\n\nIf Georgina says that Kaye got left off the list because she does not live on the farm any more, then everyone will take her word for it because that is the way things are. Some people can tell a lie to a stranger, some people cannot, but it is just about impossible to get away with telling a fib to a DRO, a poll clerk and three or four party scrutineers from your home town; any or all of whom could easily catch you out.\n\nThe Ontario election used the federal permanent voters list instead of their own enumeration and advertised for revisions. Almost every voter in certain polls in Toronto had moved during the intervening two year period. I know we will find the same thing next time in places like downtown Vancouver and, in particular, Vancouver East. If we do not reintroduce some mandatory enumeration of polls with a high proportion of renters or tenants we may wind up with the American situation where only rich people and homeowners get around to registering and voting. That would be a shame, unfair and undemocratic.\n\nThe other provision I cannot support and my party cannot support relates to returning officers. They are now able to vote, which is okay, but they are still appointed by the government. This is significant because they hold the job until they die or the riding boundaries change. These positions should be awarded after a competition on the basis of merit. A whole new merit system would be quite a refreshing change in the House of Commons. It is the only way to maintain the appearance of neutrality, as well as the practice.\n\nWhat is missing? There were several issues omitted from this review of the elections act, a number of which are very important to the New Democratic Party.\n\nAt our recent policy convention we adopted a paper on democratic reform which made a number of recommendations, including promoting a form of proportional representation as appropriate for our country. A system of proportional representation would contribute to the Canadian sense that the House of Commons belonged to them and would reduce regional frictions, resulting in a more dynamic and equitable democracy in Canada, which is another refreshing suggestion.\n\nThe government and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs decided not to examine proportional representation, or PR as we call it, in spite of a very thorough presentation by my colleague, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, and a lot of interest around the table. Given the level of cynicism about politics these days it is a pretty grave omission.\n\nPeople feel their vote does not count when the allocation of seats in parliament does not fairly reflect the distribution of the popular vote. A modified system of PR, where most of the seats in the commons were still constituency based but a portion were allocated under a regional or percentage basis under a PR system, could go some way toward relieving this imbalance. PR would overcome some of the arguments about regional or provincial representation made by some defenders of the unelected, undemocratic Senate.\n\nWe would like to see the idea of fixed election dates reviewed as well. Our convention and our party supports this. This would remove one of the advantages that an incumbent political party has over every other political party in the country.\n\nFinally, the voting age has not been lowered in this version of the act. The Liberals have been trumpeting their so-called children's agenda. In my view, let the young people vote on the children's agenda. In fact, it would be interesting to see how often all party leaders volunteered to campaign in high schools if these students could actually vote.\n\nYoung people are thought responsible enough to drive at age 16. They can be held responsible for committing violent criminal acts in adult court. More than that, they will have to live with the long term implications of decisions taken by the parliament of today.\n\nUnfortunately, they are taken seriously enough by other parties in the House, some of which have been known to offer kids a free bus trip, pizza and a bit of booze to skip school and wave the flag. I believe that young people will live up to the expectations we have of them and will not disappoint us.\n\nMany support lowering the voting age to 16, including my colleague, the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, as well as the New Democratic Youth of Canada, the Nova Scotia NDP and many other organizations around the country.\n\nFinally, one thing we would like to see addressed, which was raised by my colleague from Palliser, is the use of a private person's likeness without permission in an advertisement during a campaign. This should not be allowed. We will work to see that this happens.\n\nI am glad to hear the government House leader say that he is prepared to co-operate on these issues. This week we are celebrating co-operatives week and I am pleased to see that the government House leader will co-operate with all parties to make some changes to this very important act.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to follow my hon. colleague. He has hit a very important tone; that is, on an issue such as this there should certainly be an element of co-operation\n\nI also appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly to Bill C-2, formerly Bill C-83, an act to replace the Canada Elections Act. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, this is the first attempt in over 30 years to address this problem. The way in which this country elects its representatives is the cornerstone of democracy. It is important to examine closely all of the ways in which those changes would impact on our system.\n\nTo repeat what has been said earlier, this attempt, although perhaps the bill itself may appear at first blush as being rather cumbersome and lengthy, is a very important exercise as we engage in looking at some of these changes. Such legislation is required to update the language, add new provisions and recognize the content to reflect changes in the political landscape.\n\nRoger Gibbons, a noted and highly respected political scientist and author, said that in most instances there is very little incentive to change a system that is on the government's side, a system that was responsible for electing it. I give the government some credit for having taken this bold initiative. Time will tell as to whether some of these suggested changes toward making the process more democratic will actually come to fruition.\n\nCanada's electoral laws in their current form, while still very effective, do require updating. All Canadians, not just politicians, are affected very directly by our electoral laws, as voters, political party volunteers, as well as those who work as election officials on voting days have a very unique stake in what this legislation entails.\n\nWe know that just 38% of the Canada population elected the current government, which resulted in this very precarious majority government system that we now have.\n\nI will not take the time of the House to review the bill in great depth that we are sending off to committee because it is at committee where this study will really get down to the nuts and bolts. However, I will point out a number of the positive elements as well as some of the areas of the bill that the Progressive Conservative Party takes issue with.\n\nFirst, we are pleased to see that third party spending limits have been reintroduced to the $150,000 maximum, with no more than $3,000 against the individual candidate.\n\nThe PC Party is also pleased to see that measures have been taken to control Internet advertising. There is no ignoring the advances that are being made technologically in the country and while the Internet is a remarkable tool of communication for millions of Canadians we are still fine tuning its appropriate use. One needs only to mention the issue of child pornography and other particular broadcasts that are taking place on the Internet to highlight the fact that this is an area that has to be examined very carefully. The potential for abuse is very real.\n\nBill C-2 would eliminate the possibility of adding or deleting content from political parties' election websites after a blackout period, which is 72 to 48 hours. This is a positive step. Given the fact that someone could elevate confusion just prior to an election, this is something we have to take very seriously.\n\nJust as with the Internet, the emergence of polls as an important communication tool is another element that cannot be ignored. The release of polls in relation to the proximity of election day has been an ongoing source of concern and frustration both for the elector and the electorate.\n\nI am very pleased therefore to see that the provisions in the bill would require an individual or polling company who releases a poll during a writ period to provide an in-depth analysis of the poll itself, speaking to the voracity, I suggest, and the importance of the accuracy of the information being relayed. One can only hope that this measure would dramatically reduce the number of polls that are perhaps based on inaccurate or inadequate data. I also believe that it is important that the media take greater responsibility in clearly outlining the poll's methodology and how the findings were reported.\n\nAnother very positive change that has been alluded to is the changing of the voting hours, particularly in the province of Saskatchewan, but I suggest it is as important in Chicoutimi as it is in Antigonish or anywhere in the country.\n\nAn interesting addition to the legislation that is not contained in Bill C-2 would be to require the chief electoral officer to notify the leader of a political party of any outstanding filings from candidates. This, I believe, would be consistent with the efforts to be more transparent and open as to how all financial matters are being conducted.\n\nThe Conservative Party supports the initiative of the chief electoral officer to provide candidates with an estimation of the spending limits in their respective ridings. Greater clarity and understanding of the rules of engagement are extremely important to running efficient, effective and honest elections. This is certainly a tool that would assist candidates as they undertake their election preparedness.\n\nAn examination of the finances that takes place in Bill C-2 is an extremely important part of the legislation. Increased accountability, increased accessibility, transparency and all of those fine watch words that we hear have to be more than just words.\n\nTo quote the previous speaker, there is a high degree of cynicism that exists about the process that of course flows into a degree of cynicism about politics in general. If we can address this at the outset, early in the process, the process that is responsible for each and every member of the House arriving here in Ottawa as a representative, it will perhaps help to stem, to a degree, the cynicism that does exist.\n\nBeing able to identify how much money is given to parties will allow for scrutiny. There is some concern as to how this might act as a disincentive to some, but it is certainly an important area to look at and it is one of the specific areas that we in the Conservative Party very much look forward to examining in greater detail at the committee.\n\nIt is perhaps important as well to look at the raising of the thresholds for 75% of political tax credits from $100 to $200. We have some concerns with respect to the publishing of contributor's names and specific information about where they are doing business, their location and the ways in which they may be contacted. This may be a disincentive for some and if we want to encourage people to participate on a financial level in the process I think there has to be some respect for confidentiality. However, this will be dealt with in greater detail at the committee.\n\nThe return of the $1,000 candidate's deposit also encourages people to participate in the actual process because this is the basic threshold that a person has to cross to enter into the fray. The return of the $1,000 deposit is an important change.\n\nThe current legislation simply requires that a name be provided when a donation is made. Bill C-2, just to hearken back to my earlier point, now requires that an individual must provide addresses for publication. This may raise real concerns for individuals who do not wish to have this information made public. The committee will be delving into that in greater detail.\n\nAnother area of concern that the Conservative Party has, and it is a rather vague concept, deals with the issue of party mergers. I will not get into this particular debate today. There has been a lot of debate outside of the House in a different context, and it is not something that the Conservative Party has pursued.\n\nMy initial interpretation of the section in Bill C-2 dealing with mergers requires simply that two political parties wishing to merge obtain a signature of two leaders in respective parties. I can think of a personal example where that will not happen. A 30-day waiting period is then imposed.\n\nHowever, there is some concern that when an election is called, that the merger itself would be nullified. So there is some nebulous content in the bill respecting mergers. I believe we may be heading down a slippery slope if we were to accept carte blanche what is currently in the legislation.\n\nThere is one other concern I would just like to put on the record. Our party has some difficulty with the role of the registered district agents or auditors. While the principle behind this is sound, it is imperative that the mandate and the position of this particular person be clarified in the legislation. The role of the registered district agent or auditor has far-reaching powers and it is something that must be clarified.\n\nWe are also aware of the seriousness of electoral fraud. We know it can be a problem. We must therefore empower those auditors and individuals entrusted with the role of overseeing elections with the ability to act and act with clarity and force. However, those powers must be carefully examined before they are laid down.\n\nI think there was mention of the difference between rural and the vouching for individuals. We recognize that there is in some instances in rural communities the ability of a neighbour to come and vouch for a person but there should be some clarity and perhaps a method for doing so.\n\nI am encouraged that the government has recognized this as an area for change to produce a more democratic, better functioning electoral system. I look forward to taking part in the debate at the committee and look forward to waiting to see how the government will react to the input that it will receive no doubt from all members of the opposition.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am particularly pleased to be able to speak in the debate on the new Canada elections bill. I was the chair of procedure and House affairs last year when we dealt with this matter on a preliminary basis.\n\nIt has already been mentioned by some members of the opposition that this is a large bill. The fact of the matter is that this is one of the underpinnings of our democracy. Our legislation and Elections Canada are a model to the world. People come to Ottawa regularly from other countries to examine how we do things.\n\nIt has been 30 years since there was a comprehensive review of this important piece of legislation. Over those years, of course, given the changes in technology and in communications across the country, all sorts of smaller changes have been made to it, trying to keep it up to date and so on.\n\nI am particularly pleased at this time that the government has seen fit not just to fix parts of it but to take this very basic piece of legislation and develop what is essentially a new act. The time is right for that given the changes of the last three decades.\n\nThe process on how this was done has been mentioned. It was unusual, and I realize that it may be difficult for some opposition members to understand.\n\nThe Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which is the committee responsible in the House for the Canada Elections Act, conducted an elaborate review of this last year. I recommend the report that resulted from that review to all members of the House and to anybody watching this on television. I recommend it not because it provides all the answers or that it provides a sort of complete blueprint from which this new legislation was taken, but because it presents all the views of registered parties, members of parliament, members of the House and others who appeared before the committee.\n\nThe report does not say one way or the other how it should be done. It says what particular issue is at stake, what the views are that were presented to us and whether or not the committee had a consensus view. The report, which involved very wide consultation in the House and beyond, provided the basis for the drafters of the legislation, which was very useful to them.\n\nDuring the committee's consultations, we did not start with a blank space. We had before us the work of our predecessors over the last 30 years in the House of Commons, for example the Lortie commission which the minister mentioned. We considered the recommendations of the Lortie commission, many of which have not been acted upon, with great care and included them in the committee's report.\n\nWe also considered the recommendations of the special committee of the House which dealt with electoral matters only a few years ago. We considered those and they are also referenced in the report. The drafters had the Lortie commission, the recommendations of the special committee of the House and the general framework laid out based on the consultations of last year's Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.\n\nNow, continuing the process, the minister wants the bill to go directly to committee for further consultation not only with members of the House but, as usual, by holding public hearings with people across the country. There will be further input. I commend the minister for that. It is very courageous and appropriate to get the bill into committee now so it can be debated by all members of the House.\n\nWe have now heard from the minister and a number of members of the opposition parties. There was criticism of course from the opposition parties but it was constructive criticism.\n\nBecause it is a very thick document, I would like to point out the sorts of things the bill is trying to deal with. In doing that I underestimate the bill in some ways. It is not a bill that simply fixes bits and pieces of the legislation. It is a bill that rewrites the legislation to fit with the modern era. Nevertheless, I will mention some of the specific points.\n\nLet me give some examples of the way people as voters will benefit from the legislation. Canadian voters temporarily abroad will be able to submit their ballots at embassies and consulates. The legislation has not been revised for 30 years. Thirty years ago it would have been very difficult to administer a system like this. One can well imagine people in remote embassies trying to get a valid vote back into Canada. It could have been quite difficult and could have delayed the process. We now need something easier so that is being done.\n\nThe minister made the point about signs in multiple dwelling units. We know we can canvass in buildings which are like small communities in some of our cities. People live in those communities. They walk the corridors, ride the elevators and so on. The legislation, with respect to signage from political parties, has been different inside these dwellings than it was outside. The modern reality is that many of us live in multiple dwellings. It is very appropriate that those of us who do live in those dwellings have the same chance to advertise and show our political affiliation as the people who live in single or small units.\n\nIf members think about the changes over the last 30 years, they think about the role of polls. Polls are now part of modern life like so many other things. Maybe in the backs of our minds we would like to turn the clock back to when polls did not exist but they do exist. It is now possible to sample thousands of people in a very short time and very quickly put the results of that sampling in front of people as they are watching TV at night. This is now recognized in the legislation today.\n\nThe legislation does not ban polls or anything of that sort. Among other things, it states that during an election campaign when a poll first appears, the first time it is mentioned in the campaign, the methodology, that is the exact way in which the poll was conducted, will have to be given to the public. We will know if is a straw poll and it is somebody selling hamburgers and counting the hamburgers that are red or blue or whatever the methodology may be, or if it truly is a statistically based sampling of people in all regions, people of all ages, people of different income groups and those types of thing. I think it is very appropriate nowadays because the general public is well informed about such things. Now, when a poll first appears in an election, the methodology will be described and it will allow us all to judge the reliability of the results of that polls.\n\nBecause we have so much information and it is so easy to get information out, it is very appropriate that the legislation provide us with more complete information on the registered parties, what they stand for and what their organizational basis is, more information on the candidates who run, whether they run for main line parties or some local issue of that sort, and more information on what we in the House now know as third parties.\n\nThird parties are groups that are not registered and have no running candidates in an election, but want to be able to advertise on a particular issue in a certain constituency. Again, it is very appropriate when that occurs. If it is a legitimate activity, we need to know who those people are, where they are coming from and, in this legislation, that there be information about them and spending limits—in this case $3,000 per constituency—on them in the same way as all candidates and all parties have spending limits and have to provide information.\n\nThis is a fundamental piece of legislation. The process so far has been very positive and open. It is my sense that when this gets to committee it will create great interest and input from all members. I look forward to the discussions. I urge all members to move forward so that at the end of this process we will have a new, even stronger Canada Elections Act.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I have to admit that this is one of those days when I am actually sick to my stomach to be a member of parliament. It is obscene and unconscionable that the government brings through, to serve its own ends, some of the restrictions on the freedom of speech that it is doing today.\n\nThe idea that a ruling party seeks to restrict the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election is frankly evil. The government currently uses its advertising to an unfair advantage. It uses unbridled partisan activities. I could come up with numerous examples but I do not think I need to. The population of the country knows them well.\n\nI do not understand why a government is allowed to use taxpayer funding to get themselves re-elected. I think that is wrong.\n\nCitizens should be able to enforce provisions by filing complaints with Elections Canada to prevent governments from doing those types of things with taxpayer funds.\n\nAnother aspect I would like to touch on is the whole idea of patronage. Elections Canada as an instrument of democracy is rife with people who are chosen by the government to do its bidding during elections. I cannot think of a better example in government of a totally patronage ridden system. Other countries would be wise never to copy such a thing.\n\nWith regard to spending limits, two separate court decisions in Alberta have struck down spending limits as unconstitutional. It is not the place of the government to limit the right of an individual Canadian or a group of Canadians to spend their own money in support of an idea. There is a saying that nothing is so important as an idea whose time has come, but you can bet that this government will toss as many roadblocks and obstacles at the success of an idea as it possibly can.\n\nI cite just one example among many, the Charlottetown accord. Those people who call others enemies of Canada outspent the other side by a ratio of 13:1, yet the people's voice still came through.\n\nSpending limits only really serve the interests of the governing party. I will elaborate on that later.\n\nRegarding registered party status, in March an Ontario court struck down requirements that would force a party to run 50 candidates in order to have its candidates listed with party affiliation on the ballot. By what rationale are two candidates or more not sufficient to be recognized as a political party? This is why. It is because the governing party likes big parties.\n\nThe Liberals like the idea that you cannot start up small and expand and it does not like competition. That is the reason these rules have been put in. It goes so far as to require the liquidation of a party's assets and to send the money to the receiver general for failure to run 50 candidates in an election. How dare they. Why not let the voters rather than the government decide who they want to represent them?\n\nIt is nothing but a clear attempt to stifle the formation and growth of new parties and to limit competition on the ballot. In other countries that have proportionate representation they make selections between 35 parties or more on a given ballot, yet the Liberals, the ruling party across the way, tell Canadians by this legislation that they are too stupid to make the same types of distinctions on ballots. That is exactly what the Liberals are saying by this legislation.\n\nA small issue which one of the other members touched on is the idea of party mergers. This legislation will disallow local decisions for parties to run a single candidate between them. Instead it centralizes power and requires the signature of party leaders in order to perform some sort of local merger. It disallows the idea of local decisions and local self-determination.\n\nOn the idea of voter identification, currently an electoral official may ask for proof of identification but a voter can take an oath instead. Imagine the strange and bizarre scenario where a homeless friend of the prime minister could arrive at a voting station and say “I do not have any proof of my eligibility to vote or proof of residence”. “What is your name, sir?” “John Crouton”. “Where do you live, sir?” “24 Sucks Us Drive, Ottawa, Ontario”. And that person may be eligible to vote. That is a travesty in our democracy.\n\nThat type of abuse could go on at our polling stations. Identification should be shown to prove eligibility and residence. That is only fair. It substantiates our right to vote and gives it some validity.\n\nI will talk about taxpayer subsidies. We should oppose any assistance to political parties and political lobbies from public funds. Taxpayers should not be expected to fund activities designed to persuade them how to vote. There should be no reimbursement for those types of things.\n\nOn the issue of byelections, the legislation reads now that byelections must be called within six months but not held within six months. The distinction is it allows the ruling party to time byelections according to its own circumstances which it does all too well. With new computerized voters lists there is no problem with holding elections within six months and indeed that has been done.\n\nI will quote a few different sources which I think eloquently back up some of the things I have been talking about today, some of the travesties which I think are being done to our elections act and to democracy.\n\nDave Rutherford writes a column in the province of Alberta and also runs a local talk radio show. He pointed out that one of our former prime ministers actually once said during an election campaign that it was not the time nor the place to discuss complex issues. A person who says that kind of thing is probably the type of person who wants to bring forward legislation that would restrict freedom of speech and restrict competition on the ballot. I do not doubt that for a second.\n\nThese people want to control the election agenda. They want to ensure that political parties themselves, particularly the government party, can establish the agenda of an election.\n\nUnfortunately I note that I only have one minute left in my time. I would like to quickly read into the record the type of subsidies that go on and who they benefit.\n\nThe upshot of this is that the Liberals had a spending limit of over $30 million in 1997 but surprise, $22 million of that was in direct and indirect subsidies from the Canadian taxpayer in terms of spending rebates and political tax credits.\n\nI think it is wrong. People should do what they can to fight this legislation. I urge those who challenge it in the courts to please do so. I hope that even though legislation like this was brought forward by Trudeau in 1983, again by the Conservative government when it was in office and by the NDP in British Columbia, that it once again will be thrown out as unconstitutional by the courts of this land.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to take part in a debate as important as the one we are conducting today.\n\nThe vast majority of the measures in the bill are as a result of a long broad based, painstaking consultation process. Today we are referring this bill, the new Canada Elections Act, to committee before second reading. The results of the consultation were subjected to careful analysis by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The proposed amendments to the current Canada Elections Act stem directly from that analysis which was performed by members of all parties represented in this Chamber.\n\nOur first responsibility as parliamentarians is therefore to pass those improvements into law and give Canada an elections act which is suited to the society of today and more important still, to the society of tomorrow. We should bear in mind that the new elections act we pass will govern the election of the first government of the next millennium.\n\nOur second responsibility and no less important, far from it, is to uphold Canada's role in the eyes of the whole world as a leader in democracy. The virtues of our democratic system are known and recognized the world over. In this area as others, Canada has served as a model, one which is acclaimed at home and indeed abroad.\n\nAlthough we have a firmly established reputation for democracy, we must always work continually to maintain it. Our whole democratic system in its fullest and most noble expression rests first and foremost on our electoral process, the very process which is our task to perfect here today. We must work to perfect it. We must ever strive for perfection knowing however we will never fully achieve it.\n\nNo matter how strong our collective commitment as members of parliament to the shared cause of serving Canadians may be, there will always be new circumstances, special situations, unforeseen snags and impediments along the way. Simply the process of social change, the pace of which has increased exponentially as a right of technological explosion, makes a periodic review necessary.\n\nThe amendments before us today are in keeping with the existing act's three hallmarks: fairness, transparency and accessibility. They relate chiefly to the three distinctive areas of administrative adjustments, publication bans and spending by third parties during election campaigns.\n\nOn the last point, the courts have found some aspects of the act to be too restrictive and incompatible with the charter of rights and freedoms. However while that decision settled one problem, it has created another. The result is while the official parties and candidates must abide by stringent spending rules, the third parties remain exempt. We believe this is fundamentally unfair.\n\nIn view of the broad public support in the regulation of election expenses, especially as we look to our neighbours to the south and see that it seems that now only the rich may run, there has been demonstrated public support for extending this rule to third parties. To make these rules fair for everyone, Bill C-2 will raise the spending limit for third parties to $150,000 nationally and $3,000 per riding.\n\nThe second main issue of the bill deals with the matter of publication bans which have also been contested in the courts. The regulations concerning partisan advertising and the publication of public opinion polls have been the subject of various court challenges. On this point too the new measures are based on the principles of fairness but also accessibility. They would limit publication bans to the 48 hours before the vote and require that the methodology used in opinion polls be released at the same time as the poll results.\n\nAs I have mentioned, the first major component of the bill relates to various changes of a basically administrative nature. Here more than anywhere else the three great principles of fairness, transparency and accessibility apply and are in evidence.\n\nWe had previously settled the problems relating to the release of election results and closing of polling stations given the existence of different time zones in Canada. However, we had not dealt with the special case of Saskatchewan which, unlike the other western provinces, does not move its clocks forward in summer. The bill provides for this adjustment.\n\nAnother inequity had cropped up under the current act which was with returning officers not having the right to vote except in the event of a tie. This did not appear consistent with the provisions of the charter of rights and freedoms. This bill will give the returning officers the right to vote like all Canadians. If there is a tie, there will simply be another vote.\n\nThe third point relates to urban concentration. Multi-unit buildings, condominiums and homes for the aged are proliferating in some towns and are home to a growing number of voters. We are proposing in Bill C-2 to let candidates campaign in dwellings of that type and to let tenants or owners, as the case may be, put up posters and signs.\n\nIt has been my experience that certain boards of condominiums have instituted private bylaws prohibiting canvassing which then is enforced by security guards. I was involved in one situation where the security guard was fired for having let canvassers into the building.\n\nOur existing Canada Elections Act is an exceptional, remarkably effective document which has served Canadians well for many years. Many other countries in the world would like to be able to say the same. It remains however, like many other laws, that it needs to be updated periodically. Some of its provisions are 30 years old.\n\nAs I have pointed out, the changes before us are based on a thorough analysis of the situation performed by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, an analysis which I think we can all agree is untainted by partisanship. That analysis yielded a number of suggestions and in some cases, conclusions which were included in the committee's nearly unanimous report. Based on that report the government framed the new measures that are being proposed to improve the Canada Elections Act.\n\nPersonally, I believe these new measure will achieve their purpose. I am convinced that in the medium term and the long term the new provisions will raise the quality of our democratic system to a still higher level.\n\nThe main purpose of a new elections act is to build democratic respect for the rights and freedoms of a country's citizens and let all citizens freely choose the people who will represent them, defend their rights and ultimately ensure their quality of life. I wholeheartedly recommend passage of the bill in its entirety.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, after the Constitution Act, the Canada Elections Act is, without a doubt, the cornerstone of our democracy.\n\nThe purpose of this act, which encompasses the entire electoral process, is to ensure that the rules of democracy are respected so that the House of Commons reflects, as faithfully as possible, the wishes expressed by voters.\n\nThis act has not been overhauled in over 30 years. It was time, and we might have expected Bill C-2 to opt clearly for transparency. On reading it, however, we are forced to admit that, for this government, there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip. The transparency is still veiled; I would even go so far as to say that the veils number at least seven.\n\nThere are 577 clauses in the present bill. For the initial consideration of some 250 pages of text, before Bill C-2 is referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, 301 parliamentarians will have a total of 180 minutes: three hours of debate. This will allow a mere 6% of elected members to speak. Given that nine of 18 opportunities to speak go to the government party, that leaves nine for the four opposition parties.\n\nAlready, the decision to go with this entirely parliamentary rule might suggest that the government is not too inclined to hear what the opposition might have to say on this subject.\n\nDuring the few minutes allotted to me, I would like to draw particular attention to two points that we feel are fundamental but which are striking by their very absence: democratic funding of political parties, and the method of appointing returning officers.\n\nFor over 20 years, Quebec has been able to take just pride in having had the courage to clean up party funding by allowing only individual voters to contribute to party coffers.\n\nThe contribution limit is set at $3,000 per voter. The Quebec legislation, which has been in effect for over 20 years, has been proven effective and we are sorry that Bill C-2 shows not even the hint of a desire to take a similar approach.\n\nHowever, not a month goes by that events do not make us think that perhaps the influence of contributors to the government's electoral fund is directly proportional to the size of their cheque. Is it simply by chance that the Minister of Transport is on good terms with the president of Onex? The question is put; it is up to you to come up with hypotheses.\n\nClearly, the bill before us today will not increase the public's confidence in the political parties. The old adage “Them that has gets” has not lost its meaning entirely.\n\nSo long as corporations, both large and small, can contribute to the electoral coffers as they like, with no restriction, democracy will be at risk.\n\nFor a country that wants to be the best and prides itself on being so, the federal approach to funding in this bill is an obvious blight on democracy.\n\nIn 75 days or so, we will be in the next millennium. How can we not regret the fact that this government prefers the status quo to clearly opting for transparency? Not only is the ordinary individual's perception of elected officials not improved, but, more importantly, democracy would come out ahead with legislation that recognized the vital need to give back to voters and to them alone the responsibility for the vitality of the political parties.\n\nThe second matter I would like to draw your attention to is that of the selection of returning officers.\n\nFar be it from me to cast any doubt whatsoever on the ability of the governor in council to make valid recommendations in this connection. Moreover, making the number of appointments of all kinds that fall under its jurisdiction must be a full time job. Yet the fact that appointments of returning officers are perceived as political appointments in itself casts some doubt on the impartiality of these appointments.\n\nThe role of returning officer is key to the entire electoral process. He is responsible for applying the legislation and for settling any conflicts. As everyone is aware, a decision can satisfy some and stir up controversy with others. Just how wise is it to maintain a controversial system of appointment rather than assigning this responsibility to a committee which would examine applications for the position submitted in a competition?\n\nCould a candidate defeated in a previous federal election be appointed returning officer? There have already been appointments as surprising as this within the present selection process. It is not unreasonable to believe that a committee would select from among the candidates the person best fitting the requirements of ability plus impartiality. And if, by chance, a former Bloc Quebecois candidate were to become a returning officer, there is a good chance that he or she would make an excellent one.\n\nHere again, the government had a choice of transparency, but once again it has chosen the status quo. That is a choice that we regret.\n\nOn the 18th century, Montesquieu wrote “The love of democracy is a love of equality”. Canada is a democratic country, but democracy is as fragile as fine china, and the lawmakers have a duty to protect it. Not only to protect it, but to improve it.\n\nBy maintaining the present rules for political party funding and the appointment of returning officers, Bill C-2 confirms our suspicions that the democratic discourse adopted by the government does not necessarily have as its corollary any love for equality.\n\nWe greatly regret this, and in the words of Châteaubriand, a parliamentarian himself, we are forced to acknowledge that this bill does not meet our legitimate expectations and that, “despite the efforts of democracy to raise its standards with its grand goals, its standards are lowered by its actions”.\n\nWhat a pity that the democratic habits of the Liberal Party will, instead of raising the standards of Canadian democracy, remorselessly lower those standards.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is a delight to have an opportunity to speak today to Bill C-2 to amend the elections act. My presentation will be somewhat different from some of the others we have heard so far, which I must say have all been quite interesting.\n\nI will be very specific in my comments. I want to make clear that I am not necessarily speaking in terms of advancing New Democratic Party policy. It is a policy in a number of our sections. I know it is a policy also in a number of other party sections, particularly the youth sections. I am referring in particular to section 3 of the elections act which states that every person who is a Canadian citizen and is 18 years of age or older on polling day is qualified as an elector.\n\nAs we begin the 21st century, we hear more and more from all political parties about the concern of young people. The way society and the economy are going there will be a future for them. The younger generation will be taking on major leadership roles very quickly and at very young ages.\n\nWe should listen to the words of the government House leader today when he said that we should work to make the act better for all Canadians. This is the first time we have had a chance for some major overhaul for the past almost 30 years and we should consider lowering the voting age from age 18 as it currently is to age 16.\n\nProbably most MPs like myself spend a lot of time in high schools talking to young people. If there is one point that stands out clearly it is that young people today are very informed, very serious, and very hard working. We do not often hear about them. We often hear about the ones that are the small minority, but overwhelmingly young people today are incredibly bright, hard working and dedicated to their studies.\n\nIt becomes very clear that they are very well informed about political, economic and societal issues. When it comes to elections in some cases I am prepared to say that many of Canada's young people aged 16 or 17 are probably more informed than their parents on some issues.\n\nI wonder if it is not time for us now to be as bold in our thinking as members of parliament as others in the past were bold and said against incredible opposition that it was time for women to have the vote. To think anything other than that now is absolute folly. Also it was suggested a few years ago that first nations people should have a chance to vote. To think back that we as a country only allowed first nations people to vote in the 1960 general elections is almost incredible.\n\nToday I am suggesting that young people aged 16 and 17 should be given the opportunity to participate in Canada's electoral process.\n\nSection 215 of the criminal code says that everyone is under a legal duty as a parent, foster parent, guardian, or head of a family to provide the necessities of life for a child under the age of 16 years.\n\nAt age 16 a whole number of things change for young people. At age 16, for example, they can drive any kind of vehicle on our highways. They can join and serve in the armed forces of Canada. They are eligible for adult court consideration in our justice system. They can use a firearm and go hunting. They can leave school if that is their wish. They are no longer under their parents' legal obligation to care for children. They have the legal right to get married and to raise children. They can be eligible to receive social assistance but they cannot participate in Canada's electoral process.\n\nThey are not permitted to vote. They can go hunting, drive cars, get married and join the armed forces, but we do not permit young people who wish to vote the opportunity to cast their ballots in terms of the party of their choice and of the policies of their choice. After all, people who are aged 16 and 17 probably have the most to lose or gain by policies that parties and governments put forward compared to others in society.\n\nLet us look at what happens in other jurisdictions that have given the vote to young people aged 16 and 17. There are countries which for a number of years have said that they want our young people to participate in the electoral process, to get involved. We do it for a particular set. Young people of 16 and 17 years of age are welcome to join a political party and choose the leader of that party. They are welcome to participate in enumeration during election time. They are welcome to participate and develop party policy for the New Democrats, the Reform Party, the Conservatives or the Liberals. They can choose leaders, develop policy and participate in the electoral process, but they cannot vote. There seems to be some inconsistency here, some slight hypocrisy in our positioning when we say we want to involve young people in their country's electoral process, we want them to participate but we will not let them vote on voting day.\n\nNow there is a window of opportunity which we have not had for a long time as members of parliament. We can say to young people that not only do we want them to participate in the electoral process to determine the future of their country but we certainly want them to be able to cast a vote on election day by lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. It would potentially add almost 700,000 young people to the voters list. They would not all want to vote, just as their parents do not all want to vote. A lot of adults do not vote today but the majority do.\n\nThere are jurisdictions that have permitted young people to vote. A number of years ago Brazil said it wanted 16 and 17 year olds to participate in the electoral process. There were a lot of naysayers who said that they do not care about politics and they will not participate, blah, blah, blah, but the reality is quite the contrary. The participation rate of 16 and 17 year old voters in Brazil is higher than the average. In other words, given the opportunity to involve themselves in a meaningful way in their country's future, these young people rallied to the cause, as do young people in Nicaragua. They also have the opportunity to participate and vote at ages 16 and 17. They are participating and showing interest in numbers beyond those of their parents.\n\nKnowing the young people I know and I suspect it is the same for my colleagues in the House of Commons, when we go to high schools and technical schools and we talk to these young people about the future, they have ideas. They know the situation. They have concerns. They would love to participate in the electoral process if we gave them that opportunity. From the limited information we have of those countries that permit this, not only do young people participate but they participate enthusiastically.\n\nMy understanding is that the youth wings of all the political parties in the House have endorsed this concept, at least in principle or in detail. Many of the provincial sections of our parties have adopted the idea of considering lowering the voting age from 18 to 16.\n\nAs we look through the various clauses of the elections act before us, clause 3 says a person has to be 18. Let us go back 30, 40 or 50 years, or to where we changed the age from 21 to 18. It was stated at that time that 18 year olds were much more informed than they were previously.\n\nWe all know about the technological revolution that has taken place in the last few years. Now young people are plugged into the electronic world probably a whole lot more than we are. They understand the issues. They know how to get the information. Those who wish to be are tuned in to the web pages of political parties. They are on the Internet. As a matter of fact some of them spend half their life on the Internet becoming informed about all kinds of issues.\n\nFor those young men and women who are 16 and 17 years old, let us be bold as members of parliament as we approach the 21st century and extend to them a welcoming hand. Let us say we want them to participate in their country's electoral process. For goodness sake let us give those who wish to vote the opportunity to do so.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, let me first say that I find it particularly satisfying and exciting to begin the new session of parliament with the prime objective of improving our nation's democratic process.\n\nBill C-2, the purpose of which is to replace the current Canada Elections Act, was born of a great consensus here in parliament. The measures that are being proposed are in fact the outcome of a long and comprehensive consultation exercise, a process in which all parties represented in the House took part through the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. That consultation, conducted with the highest regard for the principles of parliamentary democracy, generated many suggestions and even allowed us to draw certain conclusions. The bill we are examining today is therefore not exclusively the creation of the government; rather it reflects to a considerable extent the opinions of all parties present in the House.\n\nOur electoral system has certainly made its mark throughout the world. New democracies are taking inspiration from it and using it as a model. True, this electoral system has evolved over the years and up to now has generally served the Canadian people well. But like anything else in the real world, an electoral system is never perfect. Because the society it serves is constantly changing, our electoral system must not only keep pace with this evolution, but it should anticipate it to the greatest extent possible.\n\nWhen we come to think of it, an electoral system is never intended to respond to the limited needs of the day. On the contrary, an electoral system must anticipate tomorrow's democratic society and prepare for it. To achieve this objective, Canada has spared no effort. Over the past few years there have been countless studies and reports.\n\nThe Lortie commission on electoral reform, to name one, made numerous recommendations. Those recommendations brought about the striking of a special House committee which in turn produced five separate reports to the House of Commons.\n\nMore recently, Canada's chief electoral officer, Jean Pierre Kingsley, submitted his own report following the 1997 election. This towering mass of work bears witness to the interest parliamentarians take in electoral reform. This new bill marks its culmination.\n\nIn fact, our task is basically to improve a system that has made our democracy a source of pride and international recognition. We must correct a few imperfections, fill some gaps, update some components of the existing act to better reflect today's reality, but perhaps most important, adapt each measure to the requirements of the charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nThis latter aspect relates to some of the financial measures more specifically, the participation of third parties in election campaigns, for example. To what extent should we accept this participation and what restrictions are to be imposed on spending? Those issues have already raised much controversy, including legal action. In this regard, the new bill provides for higher limits to allowable spending, $150,000 nationally and $3,000 per riding.\n\nIn terms of administration, Bill C-2 includes a series of new measures intended to facilitate many matters and here again to better respect Canadians' rights and freedoms.\n\nAmong other measures, Bill C-2 provides that returning officers will have the right to vote, which has not been the case in the past.\n\nThe third important aspect of the bill concerns publication bans on both advertising and polls. This is another aspect of the act that has been contested before the courts. The elections act of 1974 banned all electoral advertising at the beginning of the campaign and before voting day. This was the situation until 1996 when the Alberta Court of Appeal rejected this principle in the Somerville case.\n\nAs far as publicizing the result of polls is concerned, the ban applied for 72 hours before polling. Last year however, the supreme court handed down a decision in the Thomson case declaring this to be inconsistent with the exercise of rights and freedoms. That decision of the supreme court also added an important proviso in that it stipulated voters should be given the opportunity to make up their own minds as to the credibility of polls by analysing the methodology. Thus the court was saying that parliament's restrictions might be more acceptable if they included a requirement to make the polling methodology public along with the results of each poll.\n\nAs a result, the government has opted for the best possible compromise in the new measures being put forward. First, all bans at the beginning of the electoral campaign are lifted. Second, the bans before voting day are shortened from 72 hours to 48 hours. Third, the bill requires that the publication of all public opinion polls during an election period include in the first 24 hours of publication, full details of the polling method applied. This decision first and foremost was intended to ensure fairness toward all voters.\n\nObviously some will cry censorship. They will argue that Canadian voters are perfectly capable of separating the wheat from the chaff and selecting the information that is meaningful to them. That may very well be. However the 48 hour period is a means of giving the voters a bit of a respite before they go to the polls, allowing time for personal and individual reflection without outside influence. I should note here that the supreme court in the Thomson decision did not take this reflection period into consideration. I believe this is a serious argument that brings the new measures entirely within the intent of the charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nAs to polling methodology, its publication will enable people to get a better idea of whether the results are based on professional polling or amateur surveys.\n\nIn closing, this electoral reform is yet another means of preserving what is most precious to all the people of Canada, our democracy. As we go about our day to day business we do not often have to think of it and when we do, we often see our democratic freedoms as an acquired right, perhaps even as our due. Yet it takes only passing attention to international events of late unfortunately to remind us of the richness of our democracy. It is this richness that Bill C-2 seeks to preserve.\n\nWith Canada being a world leader in this area, there is no standard to follow. We must learn as we go. We must learn from our mistakes, our imperfections and our evolution. This is exactly what electoral reform is aimed at, improving the elections act equitably and transparently. Surely it is possible in order to safeguard what we as Canadians most cherish, our democratic freedoms.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, modernizing the Canada Elections Act is of the utmost importance to update a tool that is indispensable to the framing of our democracy.\n\nI think it is not going too far to say that, after 30 years, we must carefully look at every detail of this issue. It is a start. Members of the House of Commons have done some preliminary work that is very important. But this bill is far from being perfect.\n\nIn this exercise, it is essential to keep in mind that the work that has started and will continue over the next few weeks and the next few months will serve Canadian democracy and also each Canadian who must assume his or her responsibility to vote at specific intervals.\n\nIt is important to consider certain elements which, to us, seem indispensable. This is a very laborious exercise. We are addressing issues on which it may be difficult to reach a consensus. The numerous clauses and hundreds of pages setting out the proposals to be submitted to the House at a later time force us to recognize that it is almost a monk's job that will be asked of parliamentarians.\n\nIt will be hard to agree on everything. Regarding the financing of political parties, for example, policy issues will arise that will need to be discussed. And these will be difficult issues.\n\nThere is, for example, the issue of popular financing, which was introduced in Quebec. In spite of the fact that the act marked a huge improvement in the exercise of democratic rights, it is not perfect either. Under the provincial act, a business or its members may still contribute to the financing of political parties.\n\nFor example, in a law firm, only personal contributions are allowed. However, the firm itself could very well ask its members to contribute to a political party with the promise of being reimburse by the firm. A direct link between financing and democracy is not as easy as it may seem to make. These are nuances that will be important to address in debate or in committee.\n\nThe selection of returning officers is also an issue that will have to be addressed. We need to put in place a system where returning officers at least appear to be beyond too direct political influence. In debate, it will be very interesting to hear suggestions from all political parties and all Canadians on how to improve this procedure.\n\nIt will also be important to consider issues such as the voting age. It is becoming almost unavoidable to change the legal voting age given that, as one of my colleagues noted, young people are increasingly well-informed, and from an earlier age, about the problems and challenges they will have to face during their life.\n\nIt will be important to consider changes in that respect. Letting younger people take part in a democratic process, in an election, would probably force the vast majority of Canadians to be more attuned to the priorities that are of particular concern to young people. Some of our debates, which have been going on for over 15, 25 or 30 years, will have to be set aside, so that we can deal with issues that concern young people.\n\nIn that context, we have to be open to the idea of lowering the voting age. To allow young people to vote at age sixteen might be appropriate. At that age, and even before, young people are increasingly aware of the issues confronting them. Such a change might bring some fresh air to the Canadian democracy.\n\nLet us not forget that these amendments to the Canada Elections Act concern all Canadian voters. That is why we may have to try to go as far as we can in seeking a consensus, so as to achieve near-unanimity in the House of Commons regarding this legislation.\n\nThere will obviously be policy issues involved. Each party has been adhering to certain principles for many years, even decades. In undertaking a review of such an important act, we should perhaps set aside the principles that have guided our actions in the past and be more forward-looking instead. This is important in order to give all Canadians an act that will reflect a great deal of openness regarding several issues, including financing.\n\nFinancing has always been a very divisive issue in Canada, where we have the strict public financing process as we know it in Quebec and the traditional financing system used elsewhere in the country. I think it is possible to reconcile the two and come to agree on financing methods that are acceptable to all Canadians, without contravening the principles of democracy.\n\nWe raised the issues of polls, electronic information, Internet, etc., and we will raise them again.\n\nIt is important to limit such action rationally, because it is possible—democracy is important, we must protect it—to put it to demagogic use even. Therefore, activity involving election polls and electronic information that will be distributed increasingly, both publicly and within our families, must be given a framework.\n\nI believe that the fact of having to publish the full rationality behind polls conducted will prevent, obviously, in the context of a regular election campaign, the publication of certain polls intended strictly to serve partisan purposes and to manipulate the very democratic action people are called on to take from time to time, namely vote in all good conscience. This is an important point that must be addressed.\n\nThe fact that the number of hours in which the publication of polls both rational and less rational will be controlled is surely good news and will enable all Canadians to cast their vote in an objective and rational way that will benefit the country as a whole. I believe that our role as politicians is to do everything necessary to promote transparent democracy.\n\nAmong the various parties, everything must be done, in the context of the revision of election legislation, so that the periodic act of voting by the public may be governed by objective and non partisan rules. I am sure that all the time spent revising the Canadian election legislation will be beneficial for decades to come.\n\nI thank the House for having given me a few minutes to express my thoughts.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by expressing my support for the bill introduced by the government leader and reminding members that the new measures in this bill are the result of consultation by various parties over a period of several years.\n\nFirst, with respect to the time difference dilemma, we realized that the situation of Saskatchewan called for special attention. The minister has already covered this this morning. A special amendment in the bill also applies to the various aspects of publication during an electoral campaign. The problem of blackouts arises, not just with respect to advertising per se, but also with respect to the publication of opinion polls.\n\nThe minister has set out the government's reasoning very clearly: in any democratic election, the electorate must have the final word, without any interference or influence. Under the 1974 legislation, third parties claiming to have no political affiliation could intervene financially and however they wished in an election campaign.\n\nObviously, partisan independence was quickly challenged and, in 1993, new legislation had to be introduced to limit their spending to $1,000. And this was where the domino effect of the Charter came into play, because the courts ruled that such a limit was contrary to the exercise of rights and freedoms. The solution thus led to a new problem.\n\nBut there is public pressure on the government to do something about this.\n\nPolls have shown that eight out of ten Canadians approve the imposition of third party spending limits. What is more, 79% of those polled think that these third parties should not be allowed to spend more than the candidates, as is now the case.\n\nIn this new bill, the government is therefore proposing that third party spending be capped at $150,000 nationally, and $3,000 per riding.\n\nStill on the topic of funding, another factor called for immediate attention and that was inflation. By keeping its fiscal house in order, the present government has undoubtedly managed to minimize inflation's impact in recent years.\n\nNonetheless, since the 1974 legislation, the need for improvements at the electoral level has made itself felt. And this is another of the provisions in Bill C-2.\n\nAs I indicated, the bill is a good step in the right direction. I am certain there will be other desirable measures in the not too distant future.\n\nI would like to put on record a suggestion that was made by a group of constituents in Davenport who some months ago suggested the establishment of a declined vote ballot paper. In other words, the option ought to be given to the elector to indicate that he or she declines to vote as a form of rejection, disapproval or malcontent with the candidates who are indicated on the ballot paper, none of whom meet the expectations of the elector. It is a novel idea. It is the subject of a private member's bill which I put forth. I look forward to the opportunity of explaining it in more detail at the appropriate moment.\n\nBefore concluding I will comment on the financing of election campaigns. Election campaigns need not be as expensive as they are now. They can be run on much smaller budgets, with much less publicity at the national and local levels, with perhaps more debate and with particular discussions at the community level.\n\nThere is no doubt we have a good system in place. It is the envy of many other electoral jurisdictions, but we have to make progress on the question of maintaining the electoral process as independent as possible from sectoral interests.\n\nIn that respect I urge the government to give serious consideration to the elimination of contributions by sectoral interests such as the corporate sector and organized labour and trade unions and to increase the incentives for individual contributions.\n\nUnder that kind of system which exists in some jurisdictions the head of a corporation or union would make a personal contribution. In other words, the contribution would be on a personal basis rather than on the basis of a company or a union. The person would make that contribution out of the funds available to him or her as a private citizen and not as a contribution in the name of a corporation that may pursue specific interests in the legislation in the following parliament with a specific bill under certain conditions, or may use the threat of the withdrawal of contributions in future elections as a means of obtaining the attention and bending, so to say, the will of the government of the day.\n\nThe ideal goal that we ought to be aiming for would be a system in which individual contributions would become more and more in number, thus enhancing the democratic quality of our system because it would involve more people recognizing their civic duty and their civic right to make contributions to the party of their choice, but on a private, personal and individual basis. At the same time this would be coupled with the goal of eliminating corporate sector and organized labour contributions and any contribution by a specific narrow interest in society.\n\nOne has to recognize that this is one of the issues that the government has already tackled in Bill C-2, by way of its amendments, which will deal with sectoral interests and specific interests with respect to publicity and intervention during an election period.\n\nWe are on the right path. We are moving in the right direction. We now need to build on this measure contained in Bill C-2 and move toward a system that will allow for the flourishing of individual contributions and a gradual, if not determined, elimination of contributions from the corporate and organized labour sectors.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak in opposition to the government's scheme to torpedo Bill C-2 through the House.\n\nThis bill proposes changes to the Canada Elections Act. It is a very important bill for our democracy.\n\nAs my colleagues, the hon. members for North Vancouver and Calgary West, have already pointed out, this bill was examined in committee during the first session of this parliament. Yet, the contents of the bill being introduced today prove that the Liberals have ignored the witnesses who appeared before the committee. It is as if there had been no committee hearings at all with respect to this bill.\n\nNormally bills before the House are sent to committee for study after the debate at second reading has taken place. Because the government could not get this bill passed in the first session, is it reintroducing it and sending it to the committee immediately, where it can secretly amend it? Or, is it to prevent the bill from being amended as a result of having no debate at second reading?\n\nThis bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of the Canada Elections Act, especially those that benefit the ruling party, in this case the Liberal Party. Our elections should be democratic, free and fair, offering equal opportunity to all candidates and all parties.\n\nCanadians have been asking for changes to the way we elect our federal government representatives. With this bill we see clearly that the Liberals have once again failed to respond to the wishes of Canadians. What a great way to start the second session of parliament.\n\nThis week the Liberal government that lacks vision is being particularly undemocratic with Bill C-2. The government has wasted an opportunity to modernize and democratize the Canada Elections Act. Specifically, it has failed to deliver changes to a number of things; for example, patronage appointments, party registration requirements, campaign financing, third party spending issues, the reimbursement of election expenses, voter ID and the timing of elections and byelections.\n\nIn the short time I have to speak on this bill I will say a few words about some of these areas.\n\nLet us talk about patronage appointments. Under the current elections act the system of patronage allows parties to appoint people to positions. Returning officers are political appointees. The returning officers appoint their own assistants, poll clerks and others. This is a way of rewarding the party faithful, which has no place in our electoral system. It is outrageous in what is supposed to be a non-partisan, impartial and neutral electoral organization.\n\nElections Canada always recommends against a patronage ridden system when it helps developing nations set up their electoral system. Yet, the Liberals are maintaining the system because it benefits them. They go out to preach what they do not practise at home.\n\nElections Canada has repeatedly asked the government to release it from the patronage system and allow it to hire its own staff for elections by advertising and interviewing based on ability, merit and experience. Many Reform MPs have insisted in the past that these appointed positions be advertised in newspapers for staffing instead of filling these positions as patronage appointments.\n\nThe chief electoral officer's report on the 36th general election made the same recommendations as we have been proposing on this side of the House. Opposition MPs on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs supported this position, but the Liberals opposed it, proving that the government's position is politically motivated in what should be a non-partisan situation.\n\nThe third party spending limit is proposed to be $150,000 during a federal general election, of which no more than $3,000 may be spent on any particular riding. We believe that it is not the place of government to limit the rights of individual Canadians, or group of Canadians, to spend their money in support of a cause or a candidate in federal elections.\n\nFar from levelling the playing field the Liberals are challenging the hallmarks of our democracy. For example, the ruling Liberal party has free broadcasting time based on the number of members of parliament it has, far and beyond what any other party is allowed to have. Have the Liberals changed that situation with this bill? No, absolutely not. This would give a huge advantage to the Liberals by restricting the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election.\n\nLet us talk about the requirements for registered party status. The elections act requires a political party to run 50 candidates in an election to remain a party on the ballot. The courts in Ontario say that only two candidates are needed to form a party. It is the voters, not the government, who should decide whether a party or a candidate is worthy of their vote. It is up to the voters, not the government. This is an attempt by the government to hinder the formation and growth of new parties like the Reform Party. The government is actually trying to limit competition on the ballot. It is undemocratic. It is anti-democratic. The government should be ashamed.\n\nRegarding voter identification, currently, when there is doubt about a voter's identity or right to vote, that person may be asked for proof of identification, or the voter can be asked to swear an oath. That is absolutely ridiculous. If someone is evil enough to try to commit fraud in an election, surely we can assume that the same person would have no problem swearing an oath, lying to God or to himself.\n\nRegarding electronic voting, the Liberal government is ignoring the realities of the information age in denying us the use of electronic voting methods that are more efficient, less costly and more universally accessible voting systems. In Ontario electronic council elections can be run for one-sixth of the normal cost.\n\nLet us talk about the reimbursement of a party's election expenses. The Liberals allow reimbursement of campaign expenses and then restrict eligibility for reimbursement to certain parties. What is going on here? There should be no reimbursement at all to any candidate or any party.\n\nBill C-2 retains the requirement for a candidate to deposit $1,000. The candidate's deposit should be much lower, in the interest of encouraging Canadians to participate regardless of their financial position.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many other areas where the bill could be criticized as undemocratic, including the lack of fixed dates for federal elections, the timing of byelections, government advertising or propaganda before an election, and others, but time prevents me from commenting on these matters.\n\nI would like to read an e-mail from one of my constituents. Bill Lawton states: “All in all I feel this is just an affront to democracy. This bill is really draconian and not relevant to the democratic citizenry”. My constituents know all about the bill. It is manipulation by the power hungry government in power. It is nothing less than dictatorship, worse than even the military government in Pakistan. Let alone scandals, it is enough to call this government corrupt. It is a crime in broad daylight. The government must amend Bill C-2 and restore democracy in Canada. If this bill goes through in its present form Canadian voters should refuse to vote Liberal in the next election.",

I know that under the new bill it will continue to do fine work.\n\nI have been involved directly in two elections. I do not know if Elections Canada is monitoring this speech, but if it is I want to say how well I thought it did from my own personal experience. Any Elections Canada official I had to deal with was extremely fair and I have had nothing but a good experience with the organization. I know that with the new bill it will continue to operate in a fair-handed, even manner and we look forward to the continuation of a tradition which I think Canadians hold dear, democratic elections.\n\nElections Canada really is like a referee. We have the best election when we do not notice that it is there. It is like a sports game where we do not notice the calls that are being made by the referee. There is much work that Elections Canada does in getting ready for an election, such as voters lists and setting up the polls. It is a tribute to the hard work that there are not more complaints, given the complexity of the task of having people vote in a country as large as this.\n\nI will now turn to some substantive issues which have been addressed by members opposite. The opposition has raised the issue of the bill going to committee before second reading. I want to point out to members in the Chamber and to Canadians generally that by having the bill go to committee before second reading gives committee members greater latitude for a fuller, broader debate and to make different amendments than they would otherwise be able to make if the bill went to them after second reading.\n\nThe basic principles of parliamentary procedure are that once a bill goes through second reading it has been approved in principle. Amendments that can be made are somewhat more narrowly defined than would be allowed under parliamentary law, or more narrowly defined in that they cannot go against the bill which has already been approved in principle.\n\nBy going to committee before second reading committee members can have a broader debate. They can look at numerous amendments in a broader context. Being a member of that committee I look forward to having a very full and frank debate, which will impact on all of us elected to the House as well as Canadians everywhere.\n\nThere are a number of administrative changes that are being proposed in the bill and there are reasons we need to make those changes.\n\nCanada's electoral laws are based on principles we value as a democratic society: fairness, transparency and accessibility. They provide the framework of our electoral system. A House of Commons committee has concluded that Canada's electoral law remains strong, although a number of provisions came into effect nearly 30 years ago and should be updated. The proposed administrative changes are based on the committee's report.\n\nThe first electoral administrative change I would like to talk about is the adjusting of voting hours. We will allow for the adjustment of voting hours for areas that do not switch to daylight savings time when other clocks move ahead one hour. This will ensure that polls in Saskatchewan will close either before or at the same time as polls in Alberta and British Columbia. This corrects the problem experienced in Saskatchewan in the last election.\n\nI am sure we all remember a time when it used to be a grievance of western Canadians that as they turned on their televisions on election night there was a sense that the election had already been determined even before they had cast their votes because of the time zone switch. A government may have obtained a majority once the returns were made in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and Ontario. By the time the returns got to either the prairie provinces or British Columbia, the majority had already been set and there was a sense that their vote did not matter as much.\n\nI understand that. The government was wise to try to correct it in the last parliament. Now we are fine-tuning it a bit so that we will get the results at the same time. In 1997 it made for an exciting return. All Canadians have a sense that their votes count just as much when the returns come in at roughly the same time.\n\nThe act will also provide for standardized hours of voting for a single byelection or more than one byelection in the same time zone, being from 8.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. It will enable returning officers to vote. At present they may vote only in the case of a tie. It will authorize the electronic submission of nomination papers for all candidates to take account of the advent of new technologies.\n\nIt will ensure the right of electors to post reasonable electoral signs and of candidates to canvas in multiple unit residential buildings, including condominiums, during campaigns. Having canvassed in apartment buildings, as have most of the members of the House. it is often a case of dispute between oneself and the caretaker of the premises. It will be good to have it spelled out more clearly in the Canada Elections Act that candidates actually have a right to go into apartment buildings during reasonable hours to canvas.\n\nThe act will abolish the process of vouching to reduce the risks of electoral fraud, a practice whereby rural voters could vouch for neighbours at the polling place so that they would be allowed to vote even when they had not been enumerated. It will consolidate, clarify and modernize the language and organization of the act to make it easier to understand and apply.\n\nIn regard to elections financing the bill makes a number of changes. Some of them are minor and some of them are more substantive. To offset the impact of inflation it will increase the threshold to $200 from the $100 level which was set in 1974, the 75% threshold for the political tax credit.\n\nAll of us as politicians who have to raise money understand what this means, but the general public may not. Right now, if one makes a donation to a political party one gets a tax credit for 75% of the first $100. That was set in 1974 and obviously it needs to be updated in light of inflation so we are proposing that it be raised to $200.\n\nIt will increase the threshold for disclosure to $200 from the current $100 limit. This provision ensures that all donors who contribute more than the threshold level to a registered party, candidate or third party are identified by name and address.\n\nThe issue of what level the threshold should be, whether $100 or $200, is somewhat academic. The main point is that it is an example of something that makes our system fair. If one wants to donate to a political party, whether one's name is Gerry Schwartz or some other name it becomes a matter of public record. This is one of the key elements of our electoral law that prevents corruption in our system.\n\nSomeone may want to try to influence me by making a donation to my party or to my campaign. However, if it has to be public there is a record. The opposition can obtain that record and raise the issue in the House. The local media can obtain it. This is one thing that limits the influence of big money.\n\nIn Canada we have a system of which we can be particularly proud, particularly in comparison with the system in the United States where the accusation is often made quite rightly that its politics are driven by big money. The amount of money that a congressman or senator has to raise to run for re-election in its federal system is somewhat scandalous.\n\nMy next campaign will spend in the neighbourhood of roughly $50,000. My equivalent in the United States would probably spend in the neighbourhood of millions of dollars. That is something of which all of us should be proud. It is something we should applaud. It says something very worthwhile.\n\nUnder the new act we will require a more detailed financial reporting by registered parties. It is the same issue of making sure that parties conduct their business in a transparent way. If a party is receiving money from individuals, they are registered and become public. It will also let us know what money is being spent on.\n\nDuring a campaign there are limits on what someone can spend. It should be open and transparent reporting so that we can see whether someone is trying to sneak around the campaign limits by spending money ahead of the campaign. Proper reporting is one of the cornerstones or the guardians of making sure that people do not overspend their limits.\n\nThe new act will also prohibit the transfer of surplus funds from a party or local association to a candidate after polling day. All this does is prevent someone from trying to run to raise money for their own personal benefit.\n\nI am happy the government is proceeding with the bill. As a member of the committee I look forward to debating with the opposition the merits of the bill and any amendments that will come forward from all members of the House.",

As you know, Mr. Speaker, but perhaps not everyone within hearing distance of the debate knows, we are indirectly talking about Bill C-2. The motion before the House right now is whether or not we should send the bill to committee prior to second reading.\n\nI have had some experience with this matter. I will use the first couple of minutes of my time to address what we are really supposed to be addressing today, whether or not the bill should go to committee at this time.\n\nWhen the bill was first introduced I thought it was a very good idea. We could get bills out to committee and let the members of the committee work through the bill in its initial stages so that before there is an entrenched position we could exercise the give and take of debate and give due consideration to various aspects of the bill. Hopefully we would come forward with a bill with less controversial wording and less in need of amendment. The whole idea sounded like a really good one.\n\nHow do I put this gently and within the rules of parliamentary language? I think committee work in this parliament is a sham. That is really a strong statement but it really is so, unfortunately.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I really wish they would give thoughtful attention to what I am trying to say. As defenders of democracy, as they like to call themselves, they should also be speaking the same words I am now speaking.\n\nI remember that when I was first elected in 1993 I came here and I was involved in a particular party. I brought in an amendment to a bill at committee. It was one of the first bills that went to committee before second reading. I was involved in the debate. I thought it would be great and I put forward an idea.\n\nA clear majority of members, including those on the government side, were in favour of the amendment I proposed. One Liberal member used my name and said that I had a good idea. I cannot use my own name here. It is a stifling of freedom of speech in the House of Commons. I proceeded with the amendment to the wording of the bill and assumed that it would be accepted.\n\nThere came a day some time later when we voted on clause by clause in committee. The chairman asked “Shall clause one pass, shall clause two pass, shall clause three pass”. When it came I moved an amendment to the appropriate clause as required by procedure and the Liberal members all voted against it.\n\nLater on I challenged them. I said “I thought you guys were on my side. I thought you agreed with the common sense of what I was trying to propose”. I would never divulge the name. Nor would I even identify the riding, which is within the rules here. The Liberal member to whom I spoke looked at me, shrugged his shoulders and said “We really don't have a choice”.\n\nI put forward that evidence to say that the whole process is a sham. Even though the committee will do the work, and I have no doubt that it will try to do good work, the ultimate control will come from the government House leader in that committee. He will basically dictate what the final results of the bill will be.\n\nIt is surely unfortunate that I do not have a couple of hours to debate everything. I will have to hurry. I will now talk a little about the bill. My colleague has already mentioned the magnitude of Bill C-2. It is a huge bill. It has 250-some pages. There is a lot of detail in terms of prescribing how we conduct our elections. The index alone has xxii pages, and I will talk about two of them.\n\nAccording to the government House leader who made a speech this morning, one of the topics covered is improving the way our elections work and of improving democracy in Canada. I want to talk about clause 39. It is important to actually put on the record what it says. I want to alert Canadians across the country from coast to coast who are sitting there glued to CPAC this morning to pay attention to what it says. There are several different positions. I cannot read them all but they all have this wording:\n\n—the returning officer shall solicit names of suitable persons from the candidates of the registered parties whose candidates finished first and second in the last election in the electoral district, to be submitted to the returning officer—\n\nThen it says that the candidates shall be appointed as much as possible half from the candidate's party that finished first and half from the candidate's party that finished second.\n\nIs not Elections Canada and the work of Elections Canada impartial? Is that not what democracy is? We have right in the elections act proposed by the government an entrenchment of a practice which has been in our procedures for far too long. There is a pay off if one votes correctly. The Prime Minister will tell people in his riding to vote for him and he will be able to funnel millions of taxpayers dollars into the riding. That will be their prize for voting for him.\n\nIt is time to give Canadians free choice to vote for the candidate and the party that are principled and that represent the true values of Canadians. We should not cloud that decision by the immediate appeal of having money funnelled into the riding or getting some patronage appointments at the next election because all these positions are paid for by the Canadian taxpayer via Elections Canada.\n\nI was surprised when I was first elected to find out that this process existed. In fact I was a brand new candidate back in 1993. I had never participated in elections before and one day I got a phone call telling me that the Reform Party came second in the 1988 election and that I now had the right to name all the deputy returning officers in the polls. I said, “That cannot be, Elections Canada is surely impartial. Just because we came second surely does not give me the right to now say that the people who voted for the Reform Party in the last election will now get a payoff, a government job”.\n\nThis was wrong and I recognized it right away even though I was inexperienced. I declined. I told the returning officer in Elk Island to choose the person who did it the last time if she or he did a good job. I also said that I did not care what party the person was with, but that if there was somebody who worked last time and did not do a good job that I would give my permission to fire them. I should have been out of the loop.\n\nThe principled Reform Party, not the one of political expedience doing anything that needs to be done to get elected but rather the one that is based on principle, says that the Reform Party supports giving Elections Canada the power to select and hire all of its own employees, including but not limited to returning officers, deputy returning officers and other field staff. We believe that the decision should be made on merit and on ability to do the job and not based on a debt to be paid because of having shown favour to one political party or another.\n\nIf I had time I would also love to talk about many other issues in Bill C-2 but of course with this process we cannot. I have only these few minutes and members cannot even ask me any questions. That is regrettable, I am sure.",

I do appreciate the assistance to bring in some of my colleagues whom I know are working hard at their desks on behalf of the people of Canada and their constituents.\n\nPeople often wonder why the Chamber is so sparsely populated when members of parliament speak. It is because we have so many things to do and committees are just one example. Even though the official committees are not up and running yet, although I understand they will be in a day or two, we, in particular, have caucus committees. We have interparliamentary committees of Canada and Europe that are meeting and, as we speak, the Canada-Taiwan interparliamentary committee is meeting.\n\nLast evening I had the privilege of having dinner with the parliamentary group from Barbados who are here on official business and will be here for question period. There is a lot of work to do. I recently attended a meeting of AECL where it gave us an update of its work around the world. To denigrate the work of members really is not fair. It is not something that I would do on that side of the House and would not expect it to be done here.\n\nI would say that the committee system is very clear in this government. In this place, in Ottawa, there is a role for opposition members. Sometimes I am quite surprised, actually. Were I in opposition, I think I would be substantially more aggressive in going after—",

            "text": "I might be more effective, I do not know. I will leave that for others to judge. I certainly would find more opportunities to raise issues. I do not see that.\n\nI put a proposal forward back in the Ontario legislature in 1992. In fact, I stood for the leadership of our party. One of my proposals was that a bill should not be referred to committee; an idea or a problem should be referred to committee and that a committee should be convened in an attempt to write a bill and to put forward a solution that could go in the bill rather than having the bureaucrats draft something, put it on our desk and it appears too many times to be a fait accompli.\n\nThis is about as close as I have seen any government get to that particular principle. This is taking the bill reforming the Elections Act into committee before second reading. If I were in opposition I would have my staff working overtime going through the bill. I would see this as an open and accountable government giving opposition members the opportunity to make comments at committee, to repair anything they thought needed repairing, to change parts of the bill and to have input into the process.\n\nWhat do we get? We get, I am afraid, the somewhat typical response, “If they are doing it, we must disagree with it”. That really is unfortunate. It is somewhat myopic and narrow-minded. It does not do credit to the constituents who sent these people here, who expect them to roll up their sleeves and get into committee and work with government members and other members of the opposition to make this bill a better bill. Why would anyone opposed it?\n\nMy next election will be my tenth at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. I have had some experience. In fact, my wife has had three elections. She sits on the Mississauga council. I guess one could say we are a bit of a political family. We care about the process that is in place. We care about the rules. I, along with my family and the government, believe very much that the rules need to be fair for everyone.\n\nFrankly, I would go a little further with this reform. If I have an opportunity at committee, I might even float an idea that members may accept or reject. I believe there should be a penalty for someone who does not vote. I know it is a very controversial idea, but there are places in the world where they actually do that. The penalty in Australia is a fine. It could show up on one's income tax reporting.\n\nI find it disgraceful that municipally we only get a 30% voter turnout. It is the one level of government, in my view, that impacts more directly on people's lives than any other level of government and less than 30% of the people vote. In fact, if there is not a high profile contest for mayor, quite often less than 20% of the people vote. However, they are quick to pick up the phone to call their elected representative to solve a particular problem in the community, for example, if the garbage is not picked up or they have other difficulties. They just do not accept the responsibility to cast a ballet.\n\nProvincially, that percentage goes up to between 50% and 60% depending on, I guess, the nature of the election. In the 1995 Ontario provincial election I think there was a higher voter turnout because the public generally wanted to dismiss the government of Mr. Rae that was in office. However, we have now slipped back down again. Federally, it again increases into the 65% to 75% range.\n\nWe live in a country with democratic freedom and we see other places in the world experiencing difficulties, in particular, the problems we see in Pakistan today.\n\nI had the privilege of being part of a parliamentary group visiting Croatia during the first free election since the second world war. I saw men and women lining up down the street, with tears in their eyes, having the first opportunity to actually cast a ballot.\n\nLet me tell members what that experience was like. When I walked into the polling booth there were Yugoslav soldiers with rifles on their shoulders standing on either side of the ballot box. Behind the ballot box was a life-sized picture of General Tito. It was only just a little bit intimidating to those people casting their ballot. I tried to lighten it up by pinning Canadian flags on the lapels of the soldiers but I do not think they were particularly amused by it.\n\nWhen one sees that kind of thing, when one sees people fighting and dying for freedom and democracy all around the world as we have seen in our generation, one realizes that a Canadian who does not cast a ballot unless there is a legitimate reason, although I cannot think of one other than being dead, is not living up to the responsibility that goes along with the freedom of living in such a great and democratic society.\n\nI would go even further, but the bill at least sets a level playing field, makes it fair for everybody involved and cleans up the election procedure in Canada.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am quite pleased to take the floor for the first time in this new session, and especially so because we are debating the Canada Elections Act, which is supposed to be completely amended by Bill C-2, an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons, repealing other acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts.\n\nI am very happy to take part in this debate because I have been involved in the consultations undertaken by the chief electoral officer after the May 2, 1997 election. He was looking for ways to improve this legislation which is rather outdated. For well over 30 years, it has not been revised significantly, and the chief electoral officer was striving to have it amended significantly.\n\nAfter what I had gone through and what had been reported to me in my riding during the election, I got involved in this process with the help of an excellent lawyer and friend of mine, Jean-François Lacoursière. As a legal adviser to the Bloc and a good adviser on electoral law, an area in which his expert opinion has been frequently sought, he agreed to write a report which I have tabled in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, a report we may come back to. It has hardly been mentioned.\n\nIncidentally, it is very hard to find one's way around in this bill. Mr. Lacoursière himself told me some time ago that the Canada Elections Act was very difficult to consult and to understand. This is not normal. The federal government is already being criticized for its lack of transparency. The elections act is an extremely important important tool in that it is the basis of the election process in our country.\n\nTherefore, it is important to call a spade a spade. It is important for the thousands of people who have to work with the Canada Elections Act at some point to be able to find whatever they are looking for quickly and efficiently instead of always feeling lost in the legalese used by government lawyers—we hope they themselves can find their way through it. It really is difficult to consult that document, which is at least one inch thick. Something is wrong here.\n\nThe problems raised by Mr. Lacoursière dealt with issues that will undoubtedly be raised again, issues like voting by mail, a process that is riddled with flaws, and voting at mobile polling stations, a process that will certainly have to be refined.\n\nIn my speech, I will touch on three main elements of this bill on which we are criticizing the government. First, there is political party financing, which is not a new issue but which deserves to be raised again because of the scandalous way in which political parties are managed and because of the connections that exist between large corporations and the election funds of traditional political parties in Canada.\n\nSecond, we want to address the designation of returning officers. Third, we want to talk about voter identification, something that leaves a lot to be desired and, here again, we can give some examples from Quebec.\n\nParty financing is really outdated. We have not made any progress in this area. We know full well that the legislation is full of holes that allow corporations as well as individuals to shamelessly contribute all they want to Canada's traditional political parties.\n\nIssues like the Onex proposal, which I feel, as a Quebecer, goes against the best interests of Quebec and maybe even of all of Canada and which, notwithstanding its basic flaws, demonstrates the more or less honourable relationship between the Liberal Party of Canada and the main promoter of the Onex deal, can only further undermine the proposal. We feel this entitles us to criticize this proposal all we want.\n\nIts credibility is open to question, given the known relationship between one of the major contributors to the Liberal Party, former Cabinet members and current party managers. The federal government blithely announced that there will be a moratorium, as if it were one of its own management decisions. Obviously, it is part of the Onex agenda to get the federal government involved at some point by taking such a measure to help the deal along.\n\nThe Canadian government obviously committed itself in favour of Onex, for reasons that may too shameful to mention because they are related to the financing of the party currently in office.",

            "text": "This is shameful, because it is primitive. So-called civilized societies such as ours should ensure that rules are in place to protect government decision makers from undue influence.\n\nThis is what democratic financing is all about. This is what we realized in Quebec. We set a limit of $3,000 for contributions made to political parties, and such contributions can only be made by voters.\n\nThe Parti Quebecois government is depending on no one in particular, but on everyone, whereas this government depends on financial backers such as oil and pharmaceutical companies, banks and logging companies. All these businesses contribute tens of thousands of dollars and, in return, get privileged access to the ministers and the Prime Minister. This is unacceptable, it is a unending scandal, and it is easy to figure out why the government sometimes makes very dubious decisions. It is all a matter of cause and effect.\n\nWhen the financing process is flawed, it is not possible to look after the public's interest only. The government must take other things into account, because the telephone could ring at any time and someone might say “We will remember this the next time you come looking for work or money”.\n\nNowadays, governing is complicated enough in itself. Therefore, it is a good thing that the Quebec government does not have to concern itself with private interests. This is the strength of the Quebec government, given the complexities involved. It is free to act. It only needs to do so intelligently, whereas the federal government must accommodate all kinds of phantoms who remain nameless.\n\nMy second major criticism has to do with the appointment process for returning officers. This is issue is not as well known. We are talking here about the qualifications of individuals who hold strategic positions in each of the ridings, during elections. These positions should be filled through a process that is above suspicion.\n\nHere again, what we have is basic and primitive; it does not provide any protection against abuse. All these people possess personal qualities that are beyond doubt, but there is one condition that must be met to be a returning officer for Elections Canada, or so it seems, although it is not written down anywhere: to be a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. It is even better if one has been the president or vice-president of an association, and better yet a defeated candidate.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and primitive. It smacks of the way things are done in a banana republic. Canada is one of the western democracies that go around preaching to the whole world on how things should be done. We travel all over the planet to tell people how to govern themselves, and yet to this very day we still tolerate having as one of the main, yet hidden, criteria for appointment active membership in the Liberal Party of Canada.\n\nTo top it all off, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada saw how incongruous and unacceptable the situation was, and has long been recommending that the Canadian government change the rules so that, like Quebec, there would be a competition to designate elections staff, as indeed there should be.\n\nFinally—and I shall close with this—the last weakness is that there is not a word about voters being required to identify themselves with a card or some other means. Given the impersonal character of our society and our big cities, it is completely normal for citizens to be required to identify themselves to the person at the polling station, since we know all the funny business there can be.\n\nIt is in within the order of things for voters to be required to identify themselves to whoever is duly mandated to require it before giving them authorization to vote, a fundamental right in a democracy.\n\nYet again, this is a considerable weakness in the bill and one against which we must speak out.",

I thought we did it in a very non-partisan, effective way that ended up being very succinct and to the point in terms of the kind of meaningful changes Canadians expect in terms of their electoral system.\n\nWe in Canada have a model electoral system that is emulated around the world. It is certainly considered to be one that is of great interest to nations wherever they are in the world. It underscores the great democracy that we in Canada have. It is one which I think we should be very proud of in terms of its effectiveness and what it means for Canadians wherever they may live in this great land of ours. It also underscores the values, institutions and symbols that unite us as a people and present us as an effective nation not only to ourselves internally but to the wider world community.\n\nI am a little surprised by the Reform Party, especially the member for Elk Island who tried to denigrate the things we are trying to do. Instead he should be celebrating the fact that this bill is going to committee where they can be part of a system where there can be effective changes. Instead of trying to work with the government in this all important area, Reformers are content as usual to take extremist views to try to sabotage the system. That is most unfortunate.\n\nBut then Reform is a party that is always intent on pitting region against region, people against people and group against group. It is most unfortunate that Reformers take that tact all the time. It underscores where that party is coming from. I know Canadians want and will have no part of it. What Canadians will have a part of is the government's position on this all important legislation, understanding that this is the way we have to go. We need to ensure that we do the right thing for Canadians in this area because it underscores our democratic system as we know it.\n\nThere are many issues I could get involved with, election financing for example.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the first group of amendments to Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54, an act to support electronic commerce and protect personal information.\n\nI will start by saying that we have many problems with this bill for several reasons. This explains why we are proposing so many amendments asking for the withdrawal of the bill or, at the very least, the suspension of its implementation in Quebec.\n\nWhen we deal with the second group of amendments, we will have an opportunity to discuss more specifically one particular amendment that would make this possible, should the government have the will to do so.\n\nThe purpose of the bill is, in a rapidly evolving technological context, to foster the development of electronic commerce while respecting the confidentiality of the information we supply or agree to supply, or the use that could be made of personal information provided without knowing how it is going to be used.\n\nIt should be noted that, for the past five years already, Quebec has had a law protecting personal information. The introduction or implementation of a federal act will create administrative chaos, making life very difficult for businesses. One can understand the will displayed by the federal government in this respect. In the other nine provinces, there is no law protecting personal information. Therefore the federal government has decided to go ahead and legislate. Too bad for the other provinces if they do not want their own law and are willing to withdraw from a field of jurisdiction that could be theirs. This is not the case in Quebec.\n\nQuebec has already clearly stated, through a law, its intent to protect personal information. Moreover, the civil code contains provisions making specific reference to it. Quebec businesses have to abide by the civil code provisions as well as the law.\n\nThis is why many groups appeared before the Committee during the hearings and told the government “You are placing Quebec in a very bad position, when we already have a provincial act that protects both privacy and access to information. With this new act, businesses will not always know which act to enforce and which definition to use in specific cases. Some organizations will have to abide by the federal act, others by the provincial act and others yet by both or part of one and part of the other”.\n\nOf course, the government will say “Listen, this will only take effect in three years because, in the first three years, the new act will not apply to all fields, data or businesses”. But, in three years, it will get much more extensive and will apply to everybody.\n\nThe Cabinet could make an order to withhold a particular field of activities or ensure that some sectors get under another act. But this will have to be decided by the federal government after careful consideration of its objectives and criteria. Since we all know that the Civil Code and the common law do not always have the same approach on certain issues, there will undoubtedly be differences of opinions and policies as well as differences between mechanisms adopted.\n\nI can quote a number of people who addressed this issue at the committee's hearings. I will start with the Conseil du patronat du Québec, which came to say “Inasmuch as the constitutional jurisdiction over the protection of privacy and personal information given to the provinces by section 92.13 of the British North America Act, it is obvious that the legislator”",

Today's commemoration is a deserved recognition of the hospital's contribution to the women's movement, to the community, and to medicine.\n\nThe plaque reads:\n\nWomen's College Hospital has earned a distinctive place in Canadian medical history. From its beginnings as a small outpatient clinic in 1898 to its development as a modern teaching hospital, the institution symbolizes the struggle of women to claim their place in the medical profession. It offered them opportunities in teaching and in hospital practice, which were often unavailable or extremely limited elsewhere in the country. The hospital has made innovative contribution to the treatment and diagnosis of disease through its vital focus on health issues affecting women and families.\n\nI would also like to thank Lindalee Tracy for the film Passing the Flame: The Legacy of Women's College Hospital .",

The idea is to involve young people and encourage them to think about the richness and joy of a non-violent lifestyle.\n\nI urge young and old to visit www.7wv.com, an Internet website designed by youth for youth to exchange thoughts about non-violence.\n\nI encourage all members and all Canadians to contribute to the YWCA's Week Without Violence.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will now start where I left off earlier. I will remind members who are joining us just now that we are debating Bill C-6 promoting electronic commerce and the protection of personal information. I was explaining that Quebec already has legislation to protect that field of activity and that a new federal law will only make things more complicated for the organizations that will have to abide by it, in view of the double jurisdiction that will exist because the federal government did not recognize the precedence of the Quebec act in this field.\n\nIn fact, in its March 1999 brief, the Conseil du Patronat stated “However, since subsection 92(13) of the British North America Act clearly gives the provinces jurisdiction in the area of protection of personal information and privacy and since Quebec has already enacted legislation within its jurisdiction and its borders, many jurisdictional disputes can be expected”.\n\nOf course, when the Conseil made that statement, it expected the federal legislation as it stands today to be passed. The Conseil further stated “As for Quebec consumers, they would constantly be forced to try and determine which legislation applies and choose between two types of remedies, depending on whether their information is protected by one statute or the other”.\n\nIt is important to really understand the situation because consumers will have some recourse if they feel their personal information has not been protected. However, they will have to know if it was the federal legislation or the Quebec legislation that was supposed to protect them.\n\nAlso, the Quebec Commission d'accès à l'information appeared before the committee to explain about all the problems the implementation of both these acts would cause in the field and to stress that, in the end, Quebecers have a lot to lose given the complexity of this legal issue and the fact that they are the most protected consumers in the country. If passed, this bill aimed at protecting consumers in the rest of Canada, in other words the nine provinces that do not have such legislation, will penalize Quebec consumers because the federal government has not recognized in its bill the existence of Quebec's act and the fact that the province has jurisdiction over this area.\n\nOther groups made their voices heard. I am thinking for instance of the Barreau du Québec, whose brief also stressed the complexity of such an act. It said “This means that from now on a huge number of Quebec based businesses will be subject to the federal act rather than Quebec's, which will not make it any easier for citizens trying to know what their rights are in this context of legislative changes. Moreover, businesses based in Quebec will have to master a new personal information protection system slightly different from Quebec's”.\n\nObviously, there are many differences since, as I explained earlier, Quebec is governed by civil law while the federal government follows a totally different approach, the common law. The Barreau further stated that it supports the recommendation made by the Access to Information Commission, which reads “In order to avoid any confusion and insure that Quebecers continue to enjoy the benefits of a full personal information protection system, we submit that Bill C-54 should be amended in order to provide that the act will not apply to businesses already subject to the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector Act”.\n\nAccordingly, businesses would be subject to the existing act. The federal government could reach its goal of having an act in force across Canada, but which could be different in the case of Quebec. Businesses are already familiar with it and comply with it. The Barreau goes further still, saying “In our view, the bill should incorporate Quebec's act, even with respect to federal areas of jurisdiction, so as to avoid confusion, overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec”.\n\nThis is a very interesting point of view. Normally, the federal government's approach is always the opposite. The federal government is the one interfering in provincial jurisdictions. The Barreau du Québec is saying that there is already an act so, to avoid any confusion, it should apply even where the federal act normally would. This is an interesting approach that was supported by various groups which appeared before the committee, but all of which met with the insensitivity of the federal government, the same government that, one week ago, brought us a lovely throne speech full of lofty goals on paper. We can see that, when this government says, for instance, that it wants to work with the provinces to improve the quality of life of Canadians, in practice that is not what interests it.\n\nWhat interests it is to extend its authority, to acquire greater and greater control, to be the government that plans our economic and social development and controls the protection of personal information, and so on.\n\nDay after day, in one issue after another, this government bulldozes ahead, taking over one jurisdiction after another. And, if no amendments are made, this is what is going to happen again.\n\nWe are at report stage. There is still time for the government to amend the bill. It could include provisions acknowledging the existence of Quebec's act and providing the legal framework necessary for the development of e-commerce—we are not just talking about personal information in the electronic domain in this bill; its scope is much broader—as well as ensuring the protection of personal information under the legislation that already exists in Quebec.\n\nIn this way, a reasonable balance and a workable solution could be found. I hope that there are still some sensible people left across the way and that their beautiful speeches will translate into something concrete. That is something we will see in the course of the debate and there will be an opportunity to hear what a number of my colleagues have to say about the bill this afternoon.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the first group of amendments to Bill C-6 which was formally known as Bill C-44.\n\nWe agree that there needs to be some certainty in the area of privacy. We agree there needs to be some certainty in the rules surrounding the whole electronic commerce section of business, a fairly new area. We are a little concerned that the government was probably a bit remiss in not trying to get a more co-operative approach from the provinces before embarking on its experiment in terms of privacy in the area of business, but we recognize that it is required.\n\nMy understanding is that there is a three year timeframe for the provinces to introduce their own privacy legislation. I think it is regrettable, though, that a consensus could not have been reached to allow for the provinces to be part of a program that would introduce legislation on their own. The federal government has decided to go out on its own, and my hon. colleague reminds me that it is a three year phase-in.\n\nThe answer is that the provinces will have three years to introduce legislation in this area of privacy. However, if they are not able to do that or choose not to, the federal legislation will take precedent and become the legislation in the land in the areas of privacy in commerce and business.\n\nThat still leaves the other amendments that we will be dealing with in section 2 to which I want to speak later on. We agree that there needs to be rules and legislation surrounding the area of privacy. Although we would have preferred to have a co-operative approach, most of the provinces will be introducing their own legislation to cover this area in the next three years. Therefore the federal legislation will probably not even come into effect. The provinces may have better legislation in those areas of their own which they want to put in place, and I would encourage them to do that in this timeframe.\n\nThe Reform Party supports the part 1 amendments.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I cannot say how delighted I am to speak on Bill C-6 on personal information protection and the electronic documents act.\n\nThe reason I am delighted is that today we were talking about perhaps the birth of a whole new economy for the country. Others have described it in the last 24 hours as electronic commerce becoming the central nervous system of business, society and even of government.\n\nWe truly are into a form of commercial revolution, the consequences of which are almost unpredictable. The fantastic growth in the use of the Internet in terms of business to business relationships as well as consumer to business relationships is nothing short of astonishing. To illustrate this, Internet traffic doubles every 100 days and every second of the day seven new clients sign up on the Internet. It truly is a revolution that is happening before us.\n\nLike all revolutions we actually do not realize there is a revolution going if we are part of it. One day we wake up and realize that the entire world has changed. I suspect during the industrial revolution people were not standing around talking about the revolution that was going on, except when they looked back and realized the tremendous change that had occurred.\n\nI believe, as we have heard from the Minister of Industry, the Prime Minister and government spokespersons in a variety of capacities in the last number of weeks, that Canada is to become the most electronically connected country in the world by the year 2000. There was the commitment the other day to set up 600 Internet sites across the country and to mobilize 10,000 young people to serve those sites to ensure that every Canadian from coast to coast to coast, no matter where they live, no matter the size of their community, no matter the resources at their disposal will have access to the Internet of one kind or another.\n\nObviously there is a crucial issue that has to be dealt with and Bill C-6 attempts to do that. I refer to what happened last month at Microsoft when hackers broke into the hot mail service, exposing 40 million accounts and the integrity of the e-mail system. This kind of high profile breach of security obviously is something that consumers are concerned about.\n\nMadam Speaker, I know that you are an e-commerce fan and I suspect that when you talk to your constituents about electronic commerce the kind of thing you hear is what the rest of us hear and that is that people are concerned about the security of the information they provide.\n\nWhen we send off our credit card number or when we carry out a business transaction, is it secure? Do we have confidence that the person receiving that information is the person that we expect to be receiving that information?\n\nIn Canada the electronic commerce section will grow from $1 billion in 1997 to about $13 billion by 2002. There is an incredible rate of economic change that is occurring before us. In 1998 there were 414,000 active commercial websites and by 2002 it is predicted that number will jump to 1.6 million. It is astonishing economic activity that is occurring before us. Bill C-6 attempts to build in some security in terms of personal information.\n\nToday we are dealing with the motions in Group No. 1. I want to say on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party that we will be opposing the motions in Group No. 1 put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. The reason is obvious. Bloc members believe, and they make a compelling argument, that we should have one system for the province of Quebec and one system for the rest of the country. Obviously that is going to be a messy, patchwork system of protection. We represent all Canadians in the House and we want to have a policy that will protect Canadians from coast to coast to coast.\n\nMy friends in the Bloc Quebecois argue that there is already protective legislation in the province of Quebec. They are right in that respect. It is lacking in most other jurisdictions of the country. However, to pass federal legislation that does not include all provinces and territories I think would be folly. We do not want a patchwork of different standards across the country. National standards are crucial. For that reason we feel that we must oppose this group of amendments.\n\nIt is not right or fair that some Canadians should be deprived of privacy protection because their provincial government has been slow to act. The reality is that there are some provinces that are dragging their feet on this issue. I suspect one of the reasons is that they really do not know what to do. The provincial governments are looking to the federal government to say that rather than all of the provincial jurisdictions introducing their own protective legislation, why not have a decent standard from coast to coast to coast introduced by the federal government, which is what Bill C-6 is all about.\n\nIn other policy areas where there is federal and provincial overlap both levels of government will be required to co-operate to ensure the strongest protection is given to Canadians and to reduce any confusion.\n\nI listened carefully to the speech made by my hon. friend from the Bloc Quebecois, who argued that in his judgment the legislation presently in place in Quebec would be adequate. Let us ensure that whatever is the best piece of legislation to protect the consumer will be the piece of legislation that will dominate.\n\nIn conclusion, we support the federal government in its efforts to exercise its commerce power in respect to privacy protection. We support the intent of the legislation generally, and for that reason I am afraid we will have to oppose the motions in Group No. 1.",

These motions, tabled by the Bloc, strike at the heart of Bill C-6 and indeed undermine the government's ability to introduce a national law that will protect the privacy rights of all Canadians, and I stress, all Canadians. These motions attack the government's competence to deal with federal laws that impede electronic government and electronic services delivered to all Canadians.\n\nIn our consultations at the industry committee, consumer groups and industry expressed the view that the government has achieved the right balance in Bill C-6 between the right of individuals to have some control over their personal information and to have access to avenues for effective redress, and the need of industry to collect and use personal information as a vital component of success in the information economy.\n\nFor these reasons, consumer groups like the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Consumers' Association of Canada, and industry groups like the Information Technology Association of Canada, the Canadian Marketing Association and the cable and telephone companies have all called for rapid passage of Bill C-6.\n\nSwift passage of Bill C-6 will help build the consumer trust and market certainty needed to ensure that Canada is a world leader in electronic commerce and the global information economy.\n\nThe motions tabled by the Bloc are unacceptable and must be rejected.

Bill C-6 will provide all Canadians, and I stress, all Canadians, including those in the province of Quebec, complete and comprehensive privacy coverage across our country.\n\nQuite frankly, I would have expected better of the Bloc than to table amendments which deprive all Canadians, who have no privacy protection in the private sector, of getting the benefits of this national law.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to this bill, not so much because it is back on the agenda but because I get a chance to clarify the situation once again.\n\nBill C-6 is the resurrection of Bill C-54. The purpose of this bill is to implement legislation to protect personal information at the federal level, when similar legislation already exists in Quebec. This bill will enable the federal government to interfere in a provincial jurisdiction in spite of the fact that Quebec already has a legislation protecting all personal information. This seems to me to be a rather absurd situation.\n\nI would like to quote from a letter to industry minister John Manley and signed by Denis Marsolais, the president of the Chambre des notaires du Québec, copy of which was sent to us by this organization. It reads as follows:\n\nWe submit that overlapping systems will cause undue misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and organizations subjected to two sets of regulations dealing with a single matter.\n\nThis is not a separatist speaking, but the president of the Chambre des notaires du Québec. I point this out to the previous speaker, who said that it is not surprising to see the Bloc Quebecois take this standpoint. The Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to take this standpoint; there is a consensus throughout Quebec.\n\nThe president of the Chambre des notaires also stated:\n\nEven more disturbing is part 2 of the bill. Clause 38 recognizes the validity of electronic versions of notarial acts in Quebec which are referred to in a federal law, not only if they are recognized as such under the laws of the province of Quebec but also if they are listed in one of the schedules of the legislation. These schedules would be maintained by the minister, an agency or anyone given the authority to modify them. For all these reasons and many more—\n\nThis implies that not all the reasons were listed.\n\n—we believe—\n\nThis is the president of the Chambre des notaires du Québec speaking, not a separatist member of Parliament, as my colleague opposite would have you believed. The president of the Chambre des notaires du Québec represents all the notaries in Quebec. This point of view is shared by all Quebecers, all interested parties, not only the sovereignists, not only the separatists, but even the federalists in Quebec. Everyone in Quebec knows that, for five years now, we have had an act to protect personal information, not only in the government but also in the private sector.\n\nThe amendments we have put forward only try to ensure that the federal government will respect the situation in Quebec. So, I was somewhat offended when I heard the previous speaker say “Of course, the Bloc members are always asking for something, because they do not want Canada to work”. This is utterly false. It is a matter of how things are supposed to work.\n\nThere is already legislation under Quebec's jurisdiction. Out of respect for Quebecers, the government should not have reintroduced this bill or should have amended it to ensure that Quebec's legislation would apply in that province while the federal legislation would apply elsewhere if this were what people wanted. But precedence should be given to Quebec's legislation so that our province can give personal information the protection it feels it deserves.\n\nWe live in a distinct society. The House recognized it in a motion on distinct society that was moved by the government, but ever since the motion was agreed to, the government just paid lip service to it. It is not mentioned in any legislation and whenever Quebec's distinct character, society and people have to be recognized in a bill, there is no mention of it.\n\nLiberal members say that this is the position promoted by the Bloc, by the separatists, but I invite all Canadians to assess the situation.\n\nOn the one hand, the federal government wants to introduce a bill on electronic commerce that also covers the area of personal information, while, on the other hand, Quebec has already passed a groundbreaking bill whose value was recognized by people around the world. But the federal government is now stepping in, clumsily, several years after Quebec has passed and implemented its own legislation. All of a sudden, Quebec should step aside, because it is only a province. It would appear to be saying to Quebec “You people think in a different way”.\n\nThe hon. member used the term “national legislation”. It reminds me of all the fuss about the national capital. The federal government claims to be the national government. I am sorry but, under the constitution, it is merely the federal government and should act as such, respecting the jurisdictions of other governments. Quebec has jurisdiction over personal information, and it has exercised that jurisdiction quite well for 15 or 20 years, because it has legislation in place and has enforced it.\n\nIn Quebec, we passed a first version of this legislation, and then a second one in which the protection of personal information was included.\n\nWhen we look at the whole situation, it must be understood that the position the Bloc Quebecois is fighting for is the result of a consensus in Quebec. It is supported by all kinds of organizations. For example, we have a letter from the Chambre des notaires to Mr. Manley, dated April 7, 1999, that reads—",

In his letter, the president of the Chambre des notaires—he is not a member of parliament so that I can name him—,Denis Marsolais, said “For all these reasons, among others, we believe that an amendment is necessary in order to exclude professionals, notaries as well as any other person or organization otherwise subject to Quebec's legislation from its application”.\n\nCan it be any clearer? And it is the president of the Chambre des notaires who is speaking. He represents people who deal every day with this act. These people draft contracts; they are in regular contact with governments and private corporations when they sign contracts. They know Quebec's law also applies to the private sector, and the president of Quebec's Chambre des notaires says that this bill cannot be adopted without an amendment excluding Quebec from its application on its territory.\n\nWhen Liberal members present this bill in the House, I agree they can defend its validity. I have nothing against the fact that they are saying it could be good legislation. They have the right to say those things, but they do not have the right to say that we are against it just because we are always against everything the federal government does.\n\nAs far as reasonable and interesting measures are concerned, we have a support rate very similar to that of all other opposition parties. However, we withhold support when Quebec's interests are at stake and must be defended, when we must ensure that all Quebecers are covered by legislation. This also means that this coverage must not be too extensive, because we have seen many instances of both governments legislating in the same areas of jurisdiction.\n\nMembers need only think of the administrative nightmare and the extra operating costs incurred by an insurance company that has its headquarters in Quebec but does business in other provinces, when two acts based on different sets of basic principles apply. The costs could be prohibitive.\n\nIt will also create problems for people affected by these two acts. All this because the federal government is determined to pass what it considers national legislation. It seems that the government cannot recognize that there can be solutions that are not all inclusive. It must always include all of Canada. For the government, all problems must be addressed the same way, be it in Vancouver, St. John's or Quebec City.\n\nBut that, however, is not the reality. In Quebec we have a particular civil code. The Liberal members should know that. Especially those from outside Quebec. I hope that those from Quebec have known this for a very long time. However, I do not see why they cannot be here in the House to say that it makes no sense to vote in favour of this bill.\n\nWhy do they not rise and say “As members for Quebec, we are federalists, but in this instance, Quebec legislation must be respected”. I simply cannot understand why party discipline is involved in it.\n\nI will conclude on this point. The federal government has been trying to have us swallow a bill on the protection of personal information for over a year. We are defending here all the interests of Quebecers with respect to the matter of personal information. We will defend them to the end. We will insist on our point until we get satisfaction from the government. Should the House pass this bill, it will be like all the other measures taken by the federal government that constitute the main reasons we want to leave this country, which does not understand us, and most importantly, which does not want to understand us, because of its invasive action.",

I look forward to working closely with him as we continue down the road of creating a legal framework around electronic commerce.\n\nI had many concerns, as does the Bloc, on this issue, especially on the issue of jurisdiction and how privacy specifically falls under the provincial jurisdiction of powers. Through my discussions in committee and with people in Alberta, I have come to realize that maybe there is not the conflict that the Bloc identifies on these issues.\n\nAs I speak on the motions in Group No. 1, I want to clarify that we are opposed to the Bloc motions in this group. We do in fact support the direction of the government on this legislation. My colleague from Peace River will reiterate that as we move to Group No. 2.\n\nTo summarize specifically what this bill is trying to accomplish, Bill C-6 creates a legal and regulatory framework that will be applied to the commercial use of sensitive and private information in all areas of business. Reform supports this initiative to protect privacy. Reform supports limited government and free enterprise, but recognizes the important role of government in creating an economic climate in Canada with fair and transparent rules that protect both consumers and businesses.\n\nThis is also exactly where my second concern came up during the course of dealing with this legislation, especially in committee. Is the government in creating this legal framework and formulating this legislation going to be too heavy handed on the businesses that are engaging in electronic commerce and respecting privacy currently, thereby actually putting a disincentive on industry to continue with the work it has done to allow electronic commerce to flourish in this country?\n\nThis is where we have to separate the two areas of privacy and electronic commerce. Often that gets confusing because both are very important. They have to be treated as equally important, but there are distinct differences between electronic commerce and privacy.\n\nOne of things brought to my attention while sitting on the committee was that if one looks at how electronic commerce has developed and begun to flourish, a lot of this has been done with relatively no government intervention until now. Over $1 billion of trade is being done through electronic commerce, whether it is through the Internet or other forms of electronic commerce. This consumer confidence in electronic commerce has begun with almost entirely no government intervention, which is quite phenomenal if one thinks about it.\n\nThat is one of the reasons we have to be very concerned, as I mentioned, about being too heavy handed on industries as we develop legislation that tries to encourage electronic commerce to continue. This was one of the points I tried to bring up in committee.\n\nAs I said, one of the things we cannot take lightly is the issue of privacy. Some of the companies that have been doing business on the Internet have taken privacy very seriously. That is why customers, consumers who are currently engaging in trade on the Internet, feel confident enough to disclose information on the Internet and purchase services and goods. That is a positive thing because obviously industry is doing its part.\n\nPrivacy extends far beyond the provincial jurisdiction, particularly when one starts to use mechanisms of trade that go beyond the national scope and into a global scope. Therefore, there needs to be some sort of legal framework in place which shows that Canada has certain standards when it comes to privacy that the rest of the world has to take seriously.\n\nThis is why I would like to share with my dear colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois my opinions and those of my party with respect personal information.\n\nThe provincial and federal governments should work together in this area and share responsibilities, because e-commerce is not limited to the provinces, it goes beyond provincial and national borders. It is truly a global matter.\n\nThat is the reason I wanted to bring it up specifically in my meetings with the privacy commissioner in Alberta. The Bloc had concerns with how this federal legislation would combine its resources provincially.\n\nThe privacy commissioner in Alberta stated that this fall the government is going to be coming up with legislation that is going to deal specifically with strengthening privacy legislation in Alberta. It feels that in doing so it is going to be complementary with the scope of the federal government. The federal government has outlined that once this legislation passes, it will allow a window of three years for provinces that currently do not have privacy legislation to put privacy legislation in place and make it as strong as the provinces wish. The federal government will work with the provinces to respect that.\n\nEven if there is provincial legislation that is stronger in certain aspects of privacy than the federal legislation, it will take precedence over the federal legislation. This is actually encouraged by the federal government which often does not respect much provincial jurisdiction, but in this case there is a bigger scope and I commend the minister on this.\n\nThat is where we have to try to focus specifically on this issue. I encourage my colleagues from the Bloc to look at this because if there are strong privacy laws, and I know Quebec is very proud of its current privacy legislation, it will be complementary to the federal legislation. This is one of the big reasons that the Reform Party supports this. Even in Alberta we have the privacy commissioner and others involved with this particular legislation who say it is going in the right direction and we should support it in its current form.\n\nWhen I spoke about other groups that are looking at this legislation, whether it is industry groups or privacy groups, the general consensus is that there has been a balance reached so far, especially through our deliberations in committee and through the amendments that have been proposed in the House here today. There is balance so far in taking seriously privacy concerns and those of electronic commerce. The focus has to be not so heavy handed. The Reform Party will support this legislation, until we see that the government is turning its tide and becoming too heavy handed in the process.\n\nI will not speak to the Group No. 2 motions yet but we hope at this report stage the government will consider some of the things the Reform Party has put forward when it comes to amending the privacy area especially in the areas of health services and health information. I think most Canadians agree that is very important information and should be treated as such.\n\nI am hoping the amendments I have put forward on behalf of the Reform caucus will be taken seriously. Now that I will be working with my colleague from Peace River we hope we will be taken seriously because we would like to see that area of privacy strengthened.\n\nBill C-6 includes a two year phase-in timetable after which those provinces that do not have comparable legislation would fall under the federal legislation. Currently only Quebec has this kind of comprehensive privacy protection. Alberta will be coming on board this fall. Other provinces have determined that they neither have the resources nor the inclination to create their own provincial privacy protection legislation and prefer that this be included under the broad federal legislation. The Bloc would like total exemption for any province that has or creates privacy legislation. Under this legislation that concern is taken care of.\n\nThe difficulty with provincial privacy protection legislation is that for international and interprovincial trade purposes there should be a national standard for privacy protection. Canadian businesses have asked for this in order to simplify trade rules.\n\nThose are the most important points to mention during this debate on the Group No. 1 motions. We are not really opposed to the fact that there needs to be a balance. This legislation is achieving that. But we need to keep our minds open to look at electronic commerce in a global perspective and see how legislation can be created that works positively with the provinces. This legislation does this and I would encourage my colleagues from the Bloc to consider that and look at ways to strengthen that relationship, especially when it comes to electronic commerce.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, on behalf of the PC Party of Canada, I am pleased to speak on the Group No. 1 amendments to Bill C-6, the personal information protection and electronic documents act.\n\nBefore I begin my comments I would like to thank the many witnesses who took time to make submissions either in person or in writing to the Standing Committee on Industry. Their representations were extremely helpful with respect to bringing new issues to light.\n\nI pay tribute to all my colleagues who were on the industry committee and the new colleagues who are coming on board because this is definitely a very important area. I compliment the government for bringing forth in committee an amendment to clause 18 of the bill which was identical to the one I had sponsored.\n\nWe in the PC Party believe in the need for personal privacy legislation, but we do not feel the government has adequately taken into account the views and concerns of the Ontario and Quebec governments.\n\nWe do not feel it has adequately considered the cost impact of the new regulatory regime in Bill C-6 on the private sector. We do not see the need to pass a law to meet a European Union directive when our number one e-commerce and overall trading partner has adopted a diametrically different approach. Ninety per cent of all the e-commerce traffic in this country is in trade with the U.S. Therefore I cannot see the need to rush to beat the Americans in this regard because down the road they could adopt a different standard and we would have to change.\n\nI will speak to the specific amendments tabled in Group No. 1, all of which were sponsored by the member for Témiscamingue. To be fair to the member I note for the record that the industry committee and a Bloc member at the time presented the following motion:\n\nWhereas witnesses were recently heard by the Standing Committee on Industry, on Bill C-54 concerning the major problems in implementing this legislation; and took into account the big application difficulties of this bill,\n\nWhereas the Quebec government has repeated its demand that Bill C-54 be withdrawn,\n\nThat the Committee suspend Clause by Clause consideration of Bill C-54 and ask the Industry Minister to undertake negotiations with all the provinces, to forestall any constitutional challenge that might impair the attainment of its objectives.\n\nThis motion was defeated by seven to four. It was basically the Liberal majority that won the day and it was supported by all opposition members of the committee.\n\nHaving heard many concerns from witnesses the Liberals had the choice to take their time to consider meaningful changes to Bill C-6. The Bloc, the Reform and the Conservatives were ready to work together to draft a better bill. To their credit the Liberals allowed some minor tinkering to Bill C-54 which is now Bill C-6. For example, they supported two of the sixteen amendments I brought forward, but on the major question of overall regulation in the form of excessive power granted to the privacy commissioner and provoking battles with the Ontario and Quebec governments, they refused to budge. They refused to co-operate. They refused to compromise.\n\nOn behalf of the PC Party I refuse to blindly support Bill C-6 for the sake of getting a law, any law, on personal privacy and e-commerce. One glaring example of the defects in the legislation is subclause 18(1) which would give the privacy commissioner the right to audit a company based on disputes regarding recommended business practices listed under schedule 1 of the bill.\n\nRecommended business practices are just that, recommendations. They are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such. The privacy commissioner should be allowed to conduct an audit only when there are reasonable grounds to believe the law has been violated. Audits are intrusive and place a heavy administrative burden on the business operations of Canadian companies. The audit power under Bill C-6 should only be used to cover alleged violations of mandatory obligations set out in the bill.\n\nThe privacy commissioner should not be permitted to micromanage whether a company complies with recommended business practices such as what types of passwords or encryptions are being used by a company. Therefore subclause 18(1) as presently drafted is not necessary since Bill C-6 already provides the privacy commissioner with the tools needed to ensure the compliance of schedule 1. For example, section 11 allows an individual to file a complaint if he or she feels an organization is contravening the legislation or not following a recommended business practice.\n\nFurther, clause 12 gives the privacy commissioner the power to investigate all complaints including a complaint that an organization is not following a recommended business practice.\n\nI reiterate the longstanding objections of a variety of witnesses to the far-ranging powers granted to the privacy commissioner under clauses 12 and 18. While I do not object to extending search and seizure power to the privacy commissioner under Bill C-6, it is in the best interest of all concerned that his office be required to obtain prior judicial authorization.\n\nThe lack of any obligation for the privacy commissioner to obtain the approval of our courts before exercising search and seizure power is deeply troubling.\n\nClauses 18 and 12 of Bill C-6 create a fundamental conflict by allowing the privacy commissioner both to determine whether to exercise search and seizure powers and execute those same powers. The authorization should be granted by a neutral third party as in the case of criminal investigations.\n\nBill C-6 already provides the privacy commissioner with broad investigative and audit powers. The commissioner may summon and enforce appearances of persons under oath, converse with any person, comply with the production of documents, and receive and accept any evidence in the same manner and to the same extent as the superior court.\n\nIt is for these reasons that additional safeguards are needed in Bill C-6 as it relates to the privacy commissioner or to his delegate actually entering the premises of a private organization and seizing records.\n\nThese are not just the concerns of allegedly self-interest companies. Indeed, Blair Mackenzie from the Canadian Newspaper Association told the industry committee that the provisions within Bill C-6 are “frightening”.\n\nOther witnesses have alluded to the provisions in the bill prompting challenges under the charter of rights and freedom if the privacy commissioner acted upon clause 12 or 18.\n\nI am also troubled the government did not bring forward any study or reports on the cost impact of Bill C-6. From a legal, constitutional and economic standpoint these unfettered audit powers constitute a tremendous defect in the legislation.\n\nSadly the Liberal majority decided to ignore the fears of free speech advocates, to ignore the pleas of the private sector and to chose to defeat my amendments to oblige the privacy commissioner to obtain a court order before exercising search and seizure.\n\nIf there is any reluctance I have in supporting the Group No. 1 amendments, it is due to Motions Nos. 56 and up which deal with parts 2 through 5. Most of my objections pertain to part 1 of Bill C-6.\n\nUnfortunately the familiar double dose of Liberal arrogance and heavy-handedness has left me with no choice but to support the Group No. 1 amendments on behalf of the Conservative caucus.\n\nThe Liberals had their chance to co-operate at committee to make a substantially better bill and they chose not to do so.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in today's debate on Bill C-6, an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act.\n\nThe bill that we are debating today at report stage is the old Bill C-54 which, in spite of being the most significant step taken by the federal government since 1983 to protect personal information, does not fulfil its primary objective of protecting citizens. It falls short of our expectations.\n\nThe minister has failed to put forward a bill whose real objective would be to protect people's private lives in the private sector. In a technological world where this basic right is threatened, the Minister of Industry is proposing a fragile and confusing act whose core element is a schedule that repeats verbatim the principles set out in the code of the Canadian Standards Association.\n\nThe minister's bill is one that gives huge discretionary powers to the governor in council, while not giving any authority to the privacy commissioner. This is a bill that puts the emphasis on electronic commerce at the expense of the basic concept of the right to privacy, that ignores Quebec's unique experience in the area of personal information protection in the private sector and which, ultimately, could create problems for Quebec's current legislation.\n\nBefore dealing specifically with some of the major flaws of this bill before us, I want to say a few words about the concept of privacy, which is at the core of this bill, in the context of the Canadian and Quebec legislation.\n\nThe right to privacy is a human right along with the right to equality and justice. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is celebrating this year its fiftieth anniversary and of which Canada is a member, clearly states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. The declaration also states that “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation”.\n\nIn Canada, this protection is provided under sections 7 and 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Moreover, in 1983, the Canadian government passed legislation respecting the protection of personal information that applies to over one hundred government agencies under its jurisdiction.\n\nSince then, the federal government has promised an umbrella act to force the private sector to protect personal information. Bill C-6 is the sad outcome of all this.\n\nIn Quebec, the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and in the Quebec Civil Code.\n\nFurthermore, the Quebec government is the only government in North America to have passed laws to govern the protection of privacy in the public sectors in 1982 and in the private sectors in 1994. Experts agree that Quebec's act governing the private sector is probably one of the best in the world.\n\nThe federal government is once again causing confusion, and this act will give a different meaning to the Privacy Act, just as Bill C-68 will with respect to the young offenders legislation. This is contrary to what Quebec has put in place. This bill has many flaws, it is a weak bill whose essence is in its schedule, a small one at that. Most of the provisions that will govern the protection of personal information are set out in the schedule to the bill.\n\nMoreover, this schedule is nothing more than the model code for the protection of personal information developed by the private sector and consumers as a framework to protect personal information on a voluntary basis.\n\nBy not going beyond this text, the minister endorsed neither the consumers' recommendations nor those of the privacy commissioners, who recognized that the model code proposed by the Canadian Standard Association was a good basis for reflection, but that it should be reviewed and improved if it ever were to be incorporated in the act.\n\nThis shows beyond any doubt that the minister gave precedence to economic values over social values, at a time when this fundamental right is so threatened by the expansion of electronic commerce.\n\nThis bill gives huge discretion to the governor in council. Under paragraph 27(2)b), the federal government gives itself the right to amend the act through a simple order in council, without consulting parliament.\n\nWe know that the Liberal government has mastered the art of not being accountable to parliament. Therefore, it will be possible to amend the act under the pressure of lobbying efforts on behalf of the large companies that fund traditional political parties in Canada. The Liberal Party knows what I mean.\n\nThis bill gives no power to the Privacy Commissioner. Although the other Canadian provinces followed Quebec's model, giving the commissioner the power to issue orders, the federal act does the exact opposite. Thus the commissioner will not be able to issue orders, which will make access to the act difficult for consumers and cause it to have no effect on business.\n\nThis bill ignores Quebec's unique experience. It ignores its unique experience in the protection of personal information in the private sector.\n\nHere are some examples: the objectives of the act are better defined in the Quebec legislation because the purpose is to protect privacy independently of any commercial consideration; the Quebec legislation clearly covers all undertakings, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, whereas the federal calls for the protection of personal information only for commercial transactions; Quebec's act allows a group of individuals to appoint a representative in a class action case. There is no such provision in the federal bill.\n\nIt is therefore obvious that this is a bill with the potential to make life difficult in Quebec. In addition to all the flaws that have been pointed out, there is one still greater area of concern. The only guarantee Quebec has that it will be exempted from this legislation is a timid statement by the Minister of Industry. Its mistrust is in large part motivated by Quebec's past experience with certain formal commitments made to it, about which the federal government has too often kept mum or which it has denied.\n\nFor example, I will remind this government if I may of the present Prime Minister's promises made within days of the 1995 referendum in the Verdun auditorium.\n\nThe stakes are clear, then. For the Minister of Industry, it is a question of ensuring that Canada participates fully in the rapidly expanding e-commerce without inordinate concern about peoples' worries about their privacy. Nor does the Minister of Industry hesitate to adopt a centralizing position that runs counter in a number of respects to what should be done in the provinces of Canada, and could have served as a model to Quebec in particular.\n\nAs the Deputy Premier of Quebec so aptly put it, “If Quebec were to participate fully in the concert of nations, its culture and the protection of its policy on the privacy of personal information, as concretized in its charter, its Civil Code and its two pieces of privacy legislation, would have been advanced by its government at the Ottawa OECD meeting in Ottawa”.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois calls for immediate withdrawal of Bill C-6.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on Bill C-6, which affects a fundamental value in our society, privacy protection.\n\nThe debate goes beyond these walls. On November 2, 1998, parliamentarians, as well as Quebecers, had the opportunity to read in Le Devoir an article entitled “Pressure is mounting for consumers' privacy protection”.\n\nThe article talked about threats against our privacy and the need for citizens to be well informed of their rights. It also talked about the bill and some aspects of it that we are discussing today in the House. This article clearly specified that provinces that will not pass legislation in this area will have to comply with federal legislation within three years.\n\nYet, the need for legislation protecting personal information and privacy is not new.\n\nMost provinces already have such legislation. In this instance, the federal government has long been delaying taking its responsibilities by introducing a bill that would apply only to corporations under its jurisdiction.\n\nIn fact, we were expecting something from this government, that it take its cue from provincial laws already in place to introduce a consistent, efficient and clear bill, one that is in keeping with those provinces' jurisdictions. Unfortunately for all Quebecers and Canadians, this bill fails miserably.\n\nInstead of protecting privacy, the bill limits itself to protecting the right of big business to make profits with as few restrictions as possible. This is totally unacceptable. The federal government must get the bill back to the drawing board as quickly as possible. It must introduce a bill really aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nIf the government is not yet convinced that it is urgent to act, that the situation is urgent, it should get in touch with the president of the Quebec access to information commission. The Minister of Industry would soon find that every month the Quebec government receives 2,000 calls from people concerned about the protection of their privacy.\n\nThe Liberal Party fuels the public's cynical attitude toward politicians by using this empty and confused measure to try to convince our fellow citizens that it is concerned about the protection of privacy. The government does not say, however, that it has introduced a bill that only favours commerce, one that is predicated on voluntary compliance by businesses with its provisions to protect privacy.\n\nWhat the minister responsible is not saying is that the bill is riddled with loopholes and leaves many sectors without any protection. Those sectors that are covered by this bill are conditionally covered. This means that businesses are told to take care, if possible, of their clients' privacy. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nI want first to stress the fundamental nature of the right to privacy. It has been said before, but it is important to remind this House that the Liberal Party is putting the right to make profits before the right to privacy.\n\nExperts consider the right to privacy as a human right, the same as the right to equality and the right to justice. Thus, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—as cited by several colleagues before me—which was adopted 50 years ago by the United Nations and which Canada adhered to, specifies that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and provides that:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.\n\nIn Canada, the charter of rights and freedoms also protects privacy, although not in so many words.\n\nIn this connection, I would mention that, in Quebec, as members are undoubtedly aware, this right to privacy is recognized explicitly in Quebec's 1975 charter of rights and freedoms. Article 5 is unambiguous where privacy is concerned:\n\nEvery person is entitled to privacy.\n\nThis right is also recognized in chapter III of Quebec's Civil Code entitled “Respect of Reputation and Privacy”. I draw particular attention to article 35. This is not just something the Bloc Quebecois is pushing. I remind members that last April 7 the Chambre des notaires du Quebec wrote a letter to the minister responsible, mentioning this provision in Quebec's Civil Code.\n\nArticle 35 is clear. It says:\n\nEvery person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy. No one may invade the privacy of a person without the consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law.\n\nThat seems clear to me. Respect of privacy is a fundamental right, which is recognized internationally, as well as in Canada and in Quebec. It is ridiculous for the federal government to be introducing a bill that does not protect this fundamental right.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned a Devoir article I tabled. I see I have the House leader's attention. That article clearly said that the Government of Quebec was the only government in North America to have passed legislation protecting personal information in the public and private sectors. In addition, many experts say that Quebec's act regarding the private sector is one of the best in the world. This is a far cry from the federal act, which covers only the public sector.\n\nIt is not so surprising that the federal government did not draw upon the Quebec legislation. That would have been killing two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it would have ensured consumers of the exemplary protection of personal information, and, on the other hand, it would have avoided the loopholes and violations which are inescapable when enforcing federal and provincial laws which have not been harmonized.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the real object of this bill is not protection of privacy, but a pitiful public relations exercise. The government would like to use this legislation to show that it is finally taking heed of people's concerns. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill does not meet the expectations of those who wish for privacy. It simply serves the interests of big business.\n\nEven Canada's privacy commissioner observed that the discussion paper proposed by Industry Canada and the Department of Justice focuses mainly on commerce, not on privacy.\n\nThat is why we categorically oppose Bill C-6. The federal government refused to draw from Quebec's legislation, even if it is recognized as exemplary in this respect. This is not surprising, as the Quebec legislation focuses mainly on the protection of personal information, while the federal bill aims essentially at pleasing big business.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, with what the leader of government has done to us today, namely gagging us, it is with sadness that I am taking part in the debate on report stage of Bill C-6, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.\n\nThis bill is nothing more that a reincarnation of the bill presented by the Minister of Industry as Bill C-54 during the first session of this Parliament, and which was unanimously rejected in Quebec.\n\nSince the federal government refuses to withdraw its bill, the Bloc Quebecois and its representative on this issue, the Member for Témiscamingue, are presenting today an amendment motion whose intent is to suppress clauses of the bill which would represent a setback in the field of personal information protection in Quebec. Let us not forget that the Minister of Industry tabled his bill on personal information without waiting for the results of a consultation that he had himself launched.\n\nThe minister tabled his bill in October 1998 without waiting for the comments of his provincial counterparts to whom he had just sent a proposal of bill. However, at a meeting held in Fredericton in June of 1998, the ministers in charge of information highway agreed to consult each other on the opportunity to adopt a legislation concerning personal information protection in the private sector.\n\nOnce again, the federal government adopted a unilateral and paternalistic approach and imposed its point of view to the provinces. That is not very surprising.\n\nThe Bloc asked that the bill be withdrawn for reasons of principles, including the fact that it had been introduced without consultations and that the bill is an encroachment on provincial jurisdiction over civil law. The Bloc also asks for the withdrawal of the bill because it would represent a major weakening of the legal provisions concerning personal information protection in Quebec. The bill contains many legal deficiencies and its implementation in Quebec would cause many duplications and a lot of confusion. This is not the first time the liberal government duplicates legislation since I have been elected in this House.\n\nQuebec's legislation is based on the charter of human rights where the protection of personal information is declared a basic right. As a matter of fact, section 5 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms says that: “Every person has a right to respect for his private life.” This right is also defined and framed in the Quebec Civil Code, which states the basic principles governing the collection, retention and use of personal information.\n\nThe personal information of Quebecers is also very well protected under two laws. The first one, adopted in 1982, deals with the protection of privacy in the public sector, and the second one, adopted in 1994, extends that protection to the private sector.\n\nIt seems the federal government cannot accept the fact that Quebec has the best system in Canada and is adamant about imposing its legislation even if it means reducing the protection now enjoyed by Quebecers.\n\nAnd yet, we heard the federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs say in one of his speeches in May 1998 that we had to, and I quote:\n\n—stop using the easy way out by claiming that a government initiative responds to too much of a pressing need to be stifled by jurisdictional issues—jurisdictional conflicts create confusion that diminishes the quality of public policies.\n\nObviously, the minister does not do as he says or he does not talk often enough to his colleague, the Minister of Industry, who says it is urgent to legislate to protect the rights of Canadians and uses that as an excuse to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction and to impose a system that is criticized by Quebec's society as a whole.\n\nWhen the committee held public hearings regarding this bill, every professional, business, labour and consumer organization in Quebec expressed its preference for the system already in place in that province. This is why these organizations unanimously requested that Quebec be excluded from the application of the bill we are debating today so that the federal government does not impose upon them, with regard to the protection of personal information, a system that is different from the one that has been in place in Quebec for five years.\n\nIn a letter to the industry minister dated February 4, the Barreau du Quebec wrote:\n\nPrivacy falls under provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights—Generally, we believe that the federal access to information and privacy system is not efficient enough—the bill—should be amended in order to provide explicitly that the federal act does not apply to private sector businesses subjected to the Privacy Act.\n\nFor its part, the Chambre des notaires du Québec, which represents over 3 000 legal professionals, wrote to the industry minister on April 7 to denounce the duplications that would result from this bill being imposed on Quebec, and ask that it be amended to avoid such a situation. I will quote from its letter:\n\nWe believe the overlapping of systems will result in undue complications and misunderstandings both for consumers and organizations subject to two different sets of rules in the same area—we believe an amendment is necessary to exclude from its application professionals, notaries, and any individual or organization subject to the Quebec legislation.\n\nFinally, the Conseil interprofessionnel du Québec, with 260,000 members from 43 Quebec professional organizations, also wrote to the Minister of Industry on March 23 to tell him the following:\n\nQuebec professionals are already governed by a specific and structured set of acts and regulations tailored to the values of the Quebec people—We believe that superimposing several systems with the same intent can only cause confusion and uncertainty about citizens' rights—The emergence of another comprehensive system might unduly complicate citizens' life.\n\nAlso of concern is the fact that the second part of the bill, which deals with electronic documents, could deprive the provinces from their right to define concepts such as signature, contracts and other procedures that are now covered under civil law.\n\nGiven all the deficiencies in Bill C-6 and the threat it poses to the system now in place in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed an amendment to limit damages that this bill, if passed, could cause by explicitly excluding from its scope provinces that already have legislation on the protection of personal information in the private sector.\n\nAnother amendment is designed to maintain the privacy protection afforded to Quebecers by provincial legislation when dealing with federal companies doing business in Quebec.\n\nI am afraid that, once again, the federal government is not listening to Quebec's will and putting it in a yoke. I condemn the domineering attitude of the federal government, which wants to dictate its will to all the provinces by imposing, from sea to sea, measures that are “made in Ottawa”, without any concern for effectiveness and without taking into consideration their negative impact on citizens' rights.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to this bill. In light of the notice of motion for time allocation, I even consider it a privilege to be allowed to speak at the report stage of Bill C-6, also known as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.\n\nThis bill is identical to Bill C-54 brought forward in the last session of Parliament.\n\nI am adamantly opposed to this bill that the industry minister introduced without any consultation with the provinces and which constitutes an unacceptable intrusion in provincial areas of responsibility with respect to civil law.\n\nIncidentally, the provincial and territorial governments met on October 29 and 30 of last year and exposed the extraordinary intrusion in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions created by Bill C-54. The government is somehow attempting to recycle it as Bill C-6.\n\nThe motion in amendment before us today would delete a number of sections in this bill, which, if adopted, would mark a backward shift in the matter of protection of personal information in Quebec. This bill is very weak from a legal point of view and, without any harmonization with Quebec's legislation, its enforcement would cause confusion.\n\nAs it now stands, the bill much too flawed, from a constitutional, democratic and legal point of view. Far from improving the protection of personal information, it in fact threatens it.\n\nThis is why we are asking, and have asked already numerous times, that the federal government withdraw its bill and resume consultation with the provinces in order to table a bill that respects provincial jurisdictions.\n\nI would take advantage of this debate to remind the Minister of Industry and the hon. members on the government side that my colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques had made a motion during the 35th Parliament calling for the government to make Crown agencies subject to the Privacy Act. This motion was passed unanimously with the support of all of the Liberal members, including the ministers.\n\nUnfortunately, the government did not follow up on it. Yet now we have that same government wanting to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction while incapable of first putting its own house in order.\n\nIn light of the federal government's refusal to withdraw its bill, the Bloc Quebecois called for modifications in order to have it not apply in Quebec, where personal information is already adequately protected.\n\nIn 1982, the Government of Quebec passed legislation protecting privacy in the public sector, and Quebec is the only state in North America to have legislation protecting personal information, which it has had since 1994.\n\nThe Quebec charter of rights and freedoms, which dates from 1975, stipulates that everyone is entitled to the protection of his or her privacy. The Quebec Civil Code also addresses the protection of privacy, placing it within a framework that addresses the fundamental principles governing the gathering, retaining and use of information relating to an individual.\n\nThe two acts to which I just referred complete the Quebec legislative framework by stating the rights, obligations and rules of public and private organizations in the matter of privacy.\n\nQuebec is obviously a leader regarding the protection of personal information, but this bill could reduce the protection provided to Quebecers. Indeed, contrary to what one might have expected, Bill C-6 does not even extend to the private sector the principles governing the protection of personal information in the federal public sector. The bill does not go nearly that far. Let us look at a few flaws in this legislation.\n\nUnder the existing act, federal institutions are required to inform individuals that they collect personal information that concern them, and they must also specify how that information will be used. Under Bill C-6, this is merely a recommendation, not a requirement. The Quebec act is much more specific and strict, since it provides that any agreement relating to such disclosure or use of personal information must be expressed clearly and freely, and must be given in an informed manner and for a specific purpose.\n\nBill C-6 relies on the voluntary CSA code, whose purpose is not to protect privacy. Also, the notion of personal information is not as well defined in that code, and the definition of consent is vague. Thus, it seems that the bill primarily seeks to promote electronic commerce, at the expense of privacy protection in the private sector. This is not surprising, since the Minister of Industry has always ignored the part of his mandate that concerns consumer protection.\n\nMoreover, the remedies provided in the bill are time-consuming, costly and ineffective because the federal commissioner cannot issue orders, but can only write reports. Canadians will have to go to the federal court to settle disputes, but only after the privacy commissioner will have issued a non-binding opinion, and only after all other recourses will have been exhausted. Finally, unlike the Quebec act, the bill does not provide for criminal penalties when the principles governing the protection of personal information are breached.\n\nGiven all the flaws of Bill C-6 and the step backward it represents for Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has presented several amendments aimed at limiting the damage that may result from its overlapping the existing legislation.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois has presented several amendments which aim to limiting the damage that may cause its superimposition on the existing legislation. One of these amendments aims to explicitly exclude of the application of the bill the provinces that already have a legislation that protects personal information in the private sector.\n\nAnother amendment that we tabled will eliminate the power of the governor in council to unilaterally decide to whom the federal law applies.\n\nAnother amendment presented by the Bloc Quebecois aims at maintaining the right to privacy insured to Quebecers by the provincial legislation in their relations with federal businesses operating in Quebec.\n\nFinally, an amendment presented by our party aims at avoiding the establishment of new rules concerning the legal definition of signature and rights to a contract for the electronic sector because these questions fall under the provincial jurisdiction in matters of property and civil rights.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government are far from being the only ones in Quebec to oppose the passing of Bill C-6. They have the support of the Quebec Bar which wrote on February 4th on the then Bill C-54:\n\nThe Quebec legislator's approach seems preferable because it specifies even more the rights and duties in a legislative text that is relatively clear and simple to apply. We believe the Quebec plan to protect the personal information in the private sector is better than the one which is provided by Bill C-54.\n\nAs for the Chambre des notaires, on April 7, they wrote this:\n\nWe submit that overlapping systems will, in our opinion, cause undue misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and for organizations subjected— We believe an amendment is needed in order to exclude from its application professionals, notaries as well as any person or organization otherwise subjected to Quebec legislation.\n\nFinally, on last March 23, the Quebec Interprofessional Council, which regroups all 43 professional corporations in Quebec and some 260,000 members, wrote this:\n\nWe believe that Bill C-54 and the system it is proposing are highly inappropriate within the Quebec context, and we ask you to amend it in order to specify that it does not apply to persons or organizations already subjected to Quebec legislation in that regard.\n\nIn the wake of the 1995 referendum, the Prime Minister presented his motion on distinct society and said that he would take this notion into account when bills were passed. On June 2, the Minister of International Trade stated in an article published in La Presse that:\n\nCanada decided not to eliminate differences, but to base its future on a system of accommodation between majorities and minorities.\n\nThe minister added that Canada did not want a single legal system for everybody.\n\nTherefore I ask the Prime Minister to respect Quebec society and withdraw this bill, which, in its present form, is not acceptable to Quebec.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it strikes me has a bit odd that a bill dealing with the protection of personal information has already been put under gag order, as we are just beginning.\n\nHere we are in the high forum of debate and democracy, and as soon as we begin it, because our electors have asked for it—301 members have been elected to this House to speak on behalf of the voters—the Liberal government has the annoying habit of trotting out a gag order immediately, a time allocation order, and put an end to debate.\n\nWe must look very seriously at this strategy. The Liberal government has become the champion of the guillotine. Some of my colleagues in the Reform Party have raised this point. This concerns us very much. There a lot of things that concern us about parliamentary democracy.\n\nWithout revealing caucus secrets, I can say that we wondered about this type of expeditious and often time wasting measure, in which the government says “Into the closet with this debate. We have decided to put an end to it at a certain point”.\n\nSo we ask ourselves: is this where we are to express the views of the voters, yes or no? I would point out that the right to speak is not just allowing someone to speak for ten minutes. It is also how long the debate will last.\n\nIn fact, I recall the Liberals criticizing such proceedings with the Progressive Conservatives, when they were in power. Today, they are in power and are applying the same principle, if not doing worse.\n\nThere are a lot of other things that bother us too, debates without votes for example. I realize that there are what is now called exploratory debates. Members have a fundamental right, the right to vote. Instead of asking members to speak and to vote, the government will say “You can speak now for three or four hours, for two days, but there will be no vote following”.\n\nThe government members ought to support us and criticize these strategies as well. Without revealing what was said in caucus, I do hope they also had such a discussion. It is a fundamental right.\n\nIt is often said that power is entirely centred in the Prime Minister's Office. Here, people learn of the government positions. These are fundamental democratic issues. Today, once again, we saw how the fundamental democratic values of parliamentarians can be violated.\n\nThis is totally disgraceful. Strange to say, it happened in connection with a bill dealing with the protection of personal information. This is a fundamental issue in society. People are a bit fed up with their personal information being used and disclosed all over the place.\n\nThis is a major concern of our constituents, and today we have just been told to “Make do with a limited debate on the subject”. This is totally disgraceful. I just had to start by condemning this measure by the government.\n\nI looked at the title. The last time, when we debated old Bill C-54, there were basic differences between it and the title of the Quebec legislation.\n\nI remind the House that the Quebec legislation is entitled an “Act on the protection of personal information in the private sector”. Obviously, the Quebec government aimed mainly at protecting personal information. This is slightly different, and I would even call it the antithesis of the title of the federal bill being debated today. The title is quite long, but it is also quite revealing.\n\nHere are the first few words of the title of this bill:“an act to support and promote electronic commerce”. Right from the beginning, it is clear that the main issue is the promotion of electronic commerce. Let me read on: “by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed”—\n\nI will not read the whole title because it is quite long, but we can readily understand that the purpose of the government is always the same, that is looking after the interests of business. Personal information and human rights are an afterthought. They are not important. We have very often criticized these priorities.\n\nIf we look at campaign contributions, it is easy to understand why the federal government would want to protect its friends. Furthermore, it is intruding into Quebec's jurisdictions. Once more, those who make big contributions to campaign funds will get special treatment.\n\nI remind the House that our hands are not tied, because our party is financed through the small contributions of ordinary voters. We do everything we can to keep it like that. We go everywhere in the countryside and in the towns and cities to collect $5 or $10 contributions. That way, we are free to speak our mind, as we are doing today.\n\nWe are also free to disagree sometimes with the federal government. Most of the time, actually. We have a perfect example of that today.\n\nIn Quebec, many people have made their position clear on this issue. My colleagues have said a few words about that. The Quebec bar association, through its president, has taken a very interesting and significant stance. It goes like this:\n\nQuebec's system has been in place for almost five years; it is well known and businesses have made the adjustment. Accordingly, the Quebec Bar Association supports the basic thrust of this recommendation by the access to information commission.\n\nHere is what the commission says:\n\nIn order to avoid any confusion and so as to ensure that Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information, we submit that bill [—]\n\nToday, it is Bill C-6, previously Bill C-54,\n\n[—] should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé.\n\nThey go further still:\n\nFurthermore, in our view, the bill should include a reference to Quebec's act, even in federal areas of jurisdiction, so as to avoid confusion, overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec.\n\nOf course, for the minister and for the federal government, which is just as centralizing and paternalistic as ever, what is happening is exactly the opposite, given the sequence of events. On June 12, 1998, there was a meeting in Fredericton of ministers responsible for the information highway. At this meeting, ministers from all provinces agreed that they wanted to be advised about any protection of personal information issues.\n\nI will explain what the federal minister understands by advising the provinces. On September 21, two or three months after the meeting, the minister sent the bill in essentially the same form as it is today to the ministers concerned. On October 1, a few days later, he tabled his bill, thus bypassing completely the jurisdiction of each of these provinces, as well as the very explicit jurisdiction of Quebec, where the law has obviously proven its worth.\n\nThe president of Quebec's bar association was not the only one opposed. Other organizations spoke out as well. There was the Commission d'accès à l'information, which made a very positive assessment of the Quebec legislation five years after its enactment.\n\nWhen a province passes legislation in one of its own areas of jurisdiction, Ottawa always tries to interfere and impose a federal policy coast to coast. Several members even add the third coast.\n\nThis is another thing that is working fine in Quebec, just like the millennium scholarship fund. We have implemented some remarkable practices in Quebec. The federal minister now wants to go over Quebec's head and do things his own way.\n\nWe are getting a bit tired of the way this government's approach, and our critic in this matter is right to say that the federal minister needs to step back and withdraw this bill.\n\nBut once again, we have seen how the government operates. Not only does it not intend to withdraw the bill, but it wants to limit debate on a bill that concerns directly all voters.\n\nThe way the government is dealing not only with Bill C-54 but with all the issues I mentioned earlier is most disgraceful.\n\nThis is why I join with my colleagues to ask the government to withdraw this bill and let the provinces handle the protection of personal information.\n\nWe are doing just fine in Quebec. The federal government should act in good faith and withdraw from this area. We will deal later with the government's attempts to undermine democracy and muzzle the opposition, which we cannot tolerate.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is always with sadness that we rise in this House when we feel it is the last time the government will allow us to speak on a given bill. First of all, let me say that I too feel it is an outrage.\n\nI believe the protection of personal and private information in a bill regarding electronic commerce is something that obviously concerns us all because it very deeply affects all Quebecers and Canadians. One might wonder whether the government has something to hide.\n\nI will remind this House that the difficulty in developing a legislation is to identify the problem and to propose a bill that is so clear that it can also be implemented easily.\n\nFirst of all, the minister is trying to create dissension because he disregards this first principle. Some of my colleagues just mentioned that, in the summer of 1998 or at a meeting held in the spring of 1998, the minister discussed this issue with his colleagues. However, he presented them with a draft of the bill in September and, if my memory serves me right, he introduced his bill in this House on October 1, 1998. So much for the discussions.\n\nJust like a game or electronic commerce that the minister is getting ready to do, he is making things appearing or wandering at his will. This could instil fears into people.\n\nThe second point I wish to raise—and members will say that I am a member of the Bloc and that I am always sensitive to this question—is the issue of jurisdiction.\n\nOf course, when the British North America Act was first enacted, the issue of the protection of personal or private information in electronic commerce was surely not a concern in the legislators' mind. However, we must say that Quebec's Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector is a good one. It is applied in its jurisdiction. It is fully in force.\n\nWhat I do not understand is that the federal government, by the back door, through its Minister of Industry, wants to pass an act on electronic commerce. By saying in clause 4 that the act applies everywhere in Canada, he is looking for trouble.\n\nI said in my speech that the most difficult task was to find a justification for the enactment of a law and then to define so clearly the issue that the act can be very easily applied.\n\nBecause the minister is looking for trouble, I must say, if the bill is passed and if he continues to reject all amendments suggested by the Bloc, we will have two different jurisdictions regulating the same thing.\n\nSince everybody knows that electronic data travels very fast, merchants will have to ask themselves if the data they received or collected on a given day on their customers must be dealt with according to the Quebec act or the federal act.\n\nIf they have to transfer data to another province or elsewhere, they will have to clarify the situation before sending it.\n\nThe other issue I want to raise relates to the good faith of the Minister of Industry. In the speech he gave when he introduced the bill—I do not remember the date—he said that “Where a province adopts substantially similar legislation, the organizations covered by the provincial legislation will be exempted from the application of the federal law within that jurisdiction. Quebec already has privacy legislation similar to the bill entitled Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, so the province will be exempted from the application of the federal Bill”. That is what he said at the beginning of the debate, but I do not see anything in his bill that would confirm such a statement.\n\nThe government will have to amend the bill because the present wording does not allow for such an exemption. The only provision concerning exemptions is found in paragraph 27(2)(d). That provision allows the exemption of an organization, an activity or a category from the application of the part of the bill concerning the collection, use or disclosure of personal data inside a particular province.\n\nIn that definition of the power conferred to the governor in council, organizations and activities are mentioned, but it cannot be used to exempt everything that is done in a particular province. We already know that the legislation will have to be changed or amended accordingly.\n\nIn light of the bill's flaws, considering that electronic commerce is just beginning and will become much more prevalent in the future, and that this is a sensitive issue for Quebecers and Canadians, why did the minister not accept the Bloc Quebecois' proposal to withdraw the bill and to go back to the drawing board to harmonize this legislation with the Quebec act while also taking into account the need for legislation in the rest of Canada?\n\nIt would have been easy for the minister to do that, particularly since the government postponed the beginning of the session. In the process, former Bill C-54 died on the order paper. In the new parliament, it has now become Bill C-6. It moved up in terms of its number, but not much has moved in the minister's head or, I should say, in the department.\n\nWhy rush things now? Could it be that after this thundering and daring throne speech, the legislative agenda is such that the government must reintroduce old bills that are flawed and must rush them through parliament? I find it hard to understand. Perhaps this is what the throne speech was all about: do nothing, introduce old bills as new ones, come up with bills that we did not have time to finish debating during the last parliament. One wonders what kind of government we are dealing with.\n\nMadam Speaker, you are indicating that my time is almost up. This is unfortunate, because I would have liked to continue. I would like all parliamentarians who are here to understand—and I must point out the number of members opposite who are here on a Tuesday evening. It is remarkable to see the government benches full—",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to wish us good luck in this new session.\n\nLike my colleagues, I am pleased, following the excellent work done by the member for Mercier on Bill C-54 in the previous session, to support the work of my colleague from Témiscamingue, which I am sure will be just as excellent, on this new bill now referred to as Bill C-6.\n\nI listened carefully to my colleagues' speeches, and a particular remark made by one of my colleagues led me to slightly change my introduction to talk to you about a motion.\n\nI had forgotten to mention it in my speech. I think the motion has been adopted in early 1996 by the government party. It said that the government in its politics and decisions, should take into account the fact that Quebec is a society distinct from other Canadian provinces, motion we opposed to, need I remind you.\n\nAt the time, we opposed the motion not because of non recognition but because of the pathetic aspect of the motion or its role.\n\nWe have an outright proof of the unfounded grounds and the lack of seriousness of a parliamentary motion when such a serious subject is discussed. And the government does not take into account this same motion in the application or analysis of the bill before us.\n\nMy voters were saying “Why did the Bloc Quebecois vote against this motion, since you were being recognized.” I gave them an example and please allow me to give you the example I used with my fellow citizens, who, by the way, were laughing a lot, to illustrate the role or importance of a motion. I expressed it in the following way: When we entered the House of Commons in 1993, several members had little or no experience. We passed two bills. In 1994 or 1995, legislation was passed recognizing hockey as Canada's national sport. I myself had always thought that was the case, but they had just found it out, so we voted hockey to be the national sport.\n\nThen somebody realized that a group had been left out, and everyone must always be thought of. The aboriginal people had been forgotten, so a national sport had to be found that included them. The motion was therefore changed to read that hockey was the national winter sport, and that a summer one would be determined later.\n\nIf people do not know, the summer sport of Canadians is lacrosse. That is what the motion passed in this House states. A motion is something very important.\n\nThe following year, I was the critic for amateur sport, and I got a call from the national lacrosse team, informing me that their budget had been cut to zero.\n\nThe government had just passed a motion that this was our country's national sport. They came up with that in 1994 or 1995. I am not familiar with the statistics on participation to this sport, but in my riding I know they are relatively low. The people that play this sport are not percentages. There are few people practicing this sport. The very same year, the budget of the national team was reduced to zero.\n\nIf you want to know what a motion is worth, I have two examples: that of national sport and that of Bill C-6. In both instances, a motion was passed. I think that the Prime Minister does not perhaps recall having voted on it. However, we can see the consideration that is accorded a motion when it is time for decisions to be made.\n\nThat said, I return to Bill C-6. Often, in cavalier fashion, the government thinks, when a bill is analyzed, that we are wicked separatists and do so from a separatist standpoint. As a result, it covers its ears and does not bother to listen. It prefers to read other things, like “Awake”, perhaps.\n\nSo, in this presentation, I will draw not on a Bloc Quebecois document, but on a document by the Quebec Access to Information Commission. Even though the word “Quebec” is part of its name, the commission is not dangerous. It analyzed Bill C-54—now, Bill C-6.\n\nI know that my colleagues have used a lot of documents and committee briefs to present another vision, another aspect of Quebec's unanimous objection to this bill.\n\nI remind members that the title and the intent of the bill are based on the constitutional power of the federal government to establish a climate of trust among Canadians in the way industry gathers, uses and transmits personal information to allow e-commerce to flourish. This sector is indeed growing vigorously and must be protected.\n\nHowever, a little further along—and I will repeat the name of the group—the Quebec Access to Information Commission has said, and I quote, even if it is a bit long, but I have to quote it: “For nearly five years now, the act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector affords all Quebecers a means of protecting personal information, has proven its mettle and its usefulness”.\n\nI read on:\n\nBased on Quebec's constitutional powers in the area of property and civil rights, Quebec's act is meant to complement Quebec's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and its Civil Code. Quebec's legislation, which includes an act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information, shows how important privacy is to the lawmaker.\n\nFurther it says:\n\nThe Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector Act does not apply only to commercial activities, but also to personal information likely to be gathered, used or disclosed through electronic means.\n\nWhat the Commission d'accès à l'information explained in its brief was that, on the basis of Quebec's constitutional powers, its Civil Code, its values and customs, and also, as my colleagues explained earlier, Quebec's experience with an act which has been working well for five years, it was saying no, as we are doing now, to Bill C-54, the current Bill C-6.\n\nWhy? Because clauses 4 and 27(2) of the bill define the scope of the future federal legislation and provide that organizations or activities might be exempted from federal rules regarding the protection of personal information.\n\nAs the commission understands it, the federal legislation will apply to businesses based in Quebec or to part of their activities, unless an exemption is granted by the governor in council, which is not very likely.\n\nEven if an order was made for a Quebec business operating outside of Quebec, the federal legislation would automatically apply to 28% of Quebec businesses involved in electronic commerce with other Canadian provinces.\n\nFurther on in its submission, the Commission d'accès à l'information said:\n\nMoreover, several Quebec businesses will certainly be forced to apply both the federal and the provincial legislation at the same time, unless they have no commercial activities or none of the personal information they have is collected, used or disclosed outside Quebec.\n\nThis would limit many Quebec businesses which are open to electronic commerce but would have no contact with businesses outside Quebec.\n\nIt clearly states:\n\nWe have to oppose this proposal because every business in Quebec will have to deal with two jurisdictions, while the Quebec jurisdiction that has been existing for five years is in keeping with the standards of the OECD that were put forward by industrialized countries experimenting with electronic commerce means, even though Quebec has been demonstrating and applying them well for the past five years.\n\nAll witnesses who came before the committee, on which the hon. member for Mercier, who has now been replaced by the member for Témiscamingue, sat, have been able to show this.\n\nIn conclusion, in its submission, the Quebec Commission d'accès à l'information said:\n\nTo avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers can still enjoy a comprehensive protection of personal information system, the commission submits that Bill C-54—\n\nThis is actually Bill C-6, which was designated as C-54 at the time.\n\n—should be amended to explicitly provide that the federal act will not apply to businesses subject to the act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector.\n\nI was made to understand, while following the debate on this issue, that this amendment was rejected by the Minister of Industry and by the government.\n\nThat is why we are simply asking for the withdrawal of Bill C-6, so we can go back to square one and put in place a more credible legislation.",

Second, having tabled the bill, the government does not even want it to be debated.\n\nMy colleague the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve expressed our dismay and disapproval well when he spoke after the government House leader's announcement of the gag order. He basically said “Speak for a while and then the legislation will be passed, regardless of how well-articulated or useful your arguments may be to improve the bill”.\n\nI have been sitting in this House for more than 15 years now and, after this government took office, I have noticed a loss of what I would call the democratic tradition of this House. In fact, I am reading these days a document on the history of the House of Commons, the first debates held in this place and how well, in the early days, the members of the different parties were listening to each other.\n\nI can say that, when I arrived here in 1984, the tradition had been upheld. Amendments proposed by the opposition were often adopted by the government and consensus was often achieved, not always in the House but following a committee process.\n\nI also remember that the government House leader who imposed the guillotine was part of a threesome called the “rat pack”. These people were hysterics who tore their shirts. They even had their acronym stamped on t-shirts that they distributed to people on the street to denounce the then conservative government for having imposed the guillotine on one or two occasions. It was unbelievable to see the force and the wisdom with which they defended the principle of the democratic debate in the House.\n\nThese people who were then the guardians of democracy are today its embalmers. These members have now become like sheep whereas they were roaring like lions a few years ago.\n\nThe heritage minister also, who was by his side, was proclaiming her indignation. There was also a third member, who kept his principles. He is sitting today as the independent member for York South—Weston. He roared, but when his principles were betrayed, what did he do? He left his party, and voters in his riding re-elected him. He is a principled man.\n\nI do not share entirely his views on everything, but I say that at that time he was shouting on that side, and later on he did not bow down like a sheep, he stood up and crossed the floor.",

            "text": "He did not knuckle under, as my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is suggesting to me very wisely and accurately.\n\nI wonder what those members came to do here if not only to vote when they are told to do so. A little while ago I saw many of them, and I still see some of them, bowing their head. They have been forbidden to speak to this bill. They are ashamed, and I understand why they are looking down. I understand why they are hiding behind the curtains. I understand as well why they made signs to their leader when he came in to put the gag on us.\n\nIt is difficult to belong to a party that calls itself democratic and to be told: “Shut up. You are not here to think, you are here to vote when you are told to do so. We are four or five here to think for you”.\n\nHowever, when they make speeches in their ridings, this is not what I hear. They say that they will defend firmly the rights of the individuals, associations, businesses, industries and citizens of their ridings. We are speaking of the rights of citizens and what do they do? They do not react. They accept to remain silent about a bill that is so important that it impacts on everyone in Quebec and in Canada.\n\nI appeal to these members. I remember some speeches that the hon. member for Beauce made in his riding when he said “I will do the same as Mr. Bernier did before me”, but Mr. Bernier would have reacted to a bill like this one.\n\nThe hon. member for Beauce should be ashamed of what he said that time. If Mr. Bernier were here, he would rise and say “I do not accept that the rights of Quebecers are being trampled on in this way by this bill”.\n\nWhere is the member from Laval-Ouest? During the last electoral campaign, she engaged in debates and spoke constantly about human rights. She has not said a word about this bill.\n\nThe hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine is always lecturing us about human rights in Quebec. But what is she doing today? She remains silent on a bill we are unanimously opposed to in Quebec.\n\nAnd what is the member for Lac-Saint-Louis, a former Minister of the Environment in Quebec and a great human rights advocate doing? He also is keeping silent.\n\nI call on the member for Pierrefonds—Dollard. He is a physician. He must know what human rights are, what privacy means. But he also is saying nothing.\n\nI call on the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, a former unionist and president of the CEQ. How many times has he talked about human rights in his speeches? I was expecting him to rise and say “No, this bill does not meet the expectations of the citizens of Quebec at all. It contradicts everything that was said by all the Quebec agencies who spoke on the subject”. But no, this public defender, this former great unionist now goes along, as his leader is doing, toeing the party line.\n\nAnd what of the member for Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, who was saying the same thing during the election campaign?\n\nWorst still, where is the member for Brome—Missisquoi, a former president of the Quebec bar association? What does the bar association have to say? It says all that. However, when he was the president of the bar association, what did he do? He said “Vote for me, I will go and defend the interests of Quebec. I know that the Quebec legal system is different from what exists elsewhere in Canada, first of all because of our Civil Code”.\n\nThe organization that he was heading has told us, and the member for Terrebonne quoted it earlier, that this bill was utterly useless, and that if we really wanted to pass it, it would have to be drastically amended. This organization sent a four-page letter to every member of parliament. Where is the former president of the bar association, now the member for Brome—Missisquoi? He also is remaining silent on this bill.\n\nThen there is the member for Brossard—LaPrairie. I heard him in Shawinigan, during the 1993 election campaign, and during the 1992 referendum campaign. Together, we took part in debates. He was a great champion of rights and freedoms. Today, he is being silenced by his leader.\n\nI urge all members from Quebec to rise and uphold the rights of Quebec. I appeal particularly to the famous minister, the member for Outremont, who said “I will speak out for the rights of Quebec within the Confederation”. The time has come for him to prove he can respect Quebec. Not only Quebec, because other provinces are opposed to this, but Quebec in particular. Five years ago, it was the first region in the western world to introduce such a bill and to enact it.\n\nI appeal to all the ministers from Quebec, the Minister of Public Works, the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport. If he is now off his diet, is he now free to deal with human rights?\n\nIn concluding, I hope that in the last moments of this debate, all members from Quebec, no matter their political allegiance, will rise to tell the minister “Withdraw your bill”.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour for his excellent speech. He has reminded us that government members have remained quite silent on an issue related to the protection of personal information.\n\nIt is quite something to see that they respect a self-imposed gag order to let a bill be passed, one wonders why, when it has been condemned by just about everybody in Canada and in Quebec, because it will be detrimental to the protection of personal information. It is totally unacceptable, and I hope the people who are watching us will take good note of that.\n\nWhy do we disagree with this bill? This bill, which will support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information in certain circumstances, was introduced by the industry minister just last week.\n\nIt is identical to Bill C-54, which was introduced on October 1, 1998. This bill has already been debated. We were hoping for some amendments when the minister introduced it again as Bill C-6, because it had been so heavily criticized. But the minister is coming back with exactly the same bill as Bill C-54.\n\nWhy do we disagree? Because the industry minister has introduced this piece of legislation without any consultation with the provinces or anybody else. This bill is an intrusion into provincial jurisdictions. It will mean less protection for personal information in Quebec. Its implementation in Quebec will be a cause for confusion. If passed, this bill will be the worse administrative nightmare ever. Moreover, this bill is legally flawed.\n\nThis bill is not clear enough. All those who have examined it and appeared as witnesses before the standing committee have said so. And the list of those witnesses is impressive. We had members of the Canadian Bar Association, the CSA, the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, UQAM professors and one independent expert, Ian Lawson.\n\nI want to quote the Canadian Bar Association. “The standard was not drafted in strong enough words to make for a set of legislative rules. It does not really help to define the right to privacy or to tell the organizations to which the legislation applies how they should be protecting the people's rights”.\n\nThe Life and Health Insurance Association stated that “other provisions of the legislation are hard to interpret, especially the ones dealing with key issues such as the application and enforcement of the act”.\n\nProfessors from l'Université du Québec à Montréal stated “If one wishes to truly protect the consumer in an area as formidable as personal information, one must adopt some strict rules and not rules written in the conditional tense that, for all useful purposes, do not obligate a company to show anything more than good faith. You cannot expect this to produce that result”.\n\nI do not think one can be any clearer than that.\n\nIn Quebec, the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms that was proclaimed in 1975. Also, the Quebec government has passed the only act in America to protect personal information in the private sector. This act was enacted in 1994. As I said earlier, this act is considered a model throughout the world and should be used to draft the federal bill.\n\nGod knows why the government is disregarding it. It is trying to give its bill precedence over Quebec's legislation, which is considered as a model all over the world. Why is the minister ignoring Quebec's legislation is a model all over the world? Can anyone explain why?\n\nThe Minister of Industry acted unilaterally despite his promise to consult all the stakeholders before introducing his bill. He may have done some minor consulting to make things look good, but he did not take anything said into account and proceeded to introduce his bill.\n\nAs a matter of fact, on June 12, the ministers responsible for the electronic highway met in Fredericton and decided to consult each other, if necessary, on the advisability of passing legislation protecting personal information in the private sector.\n\nOn September 21, the federal Minister of Industry sent his provincial counterparts a draft bill and asked for their comments on wanted the federal government wanted to introduce.\n\nBut the minister did not wait for the comments; he introduced his bill immediately, on October 1, 1998. His provincial counterparts received the draft bill on September 21, 1998, but the minister did not wait for their comments and introduced, on October 1, 1998, his legislation which was then called Bill C-54.\n\nThe Minister of Industry is also responsible for creating a constitutional dispute that could have been avoided had he agreed to work in co-operation with his counterparts.\n\nThe provinces have jurisdiction in the area of personal information under the Constitution Act, 1867, which gives them powers with regard to property and civil law. Every expert consulted by the Bloc Quebecois recognizes that it is first and foremost a provincial jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, Bill C-6 says that it will apply to organizations under federal jurisdiction in their commercial activities, to organizations that transfer personal information from one province to another or from one country to another, and to employees whose personal information is collected by an organization under federal jurisdiction.\n\nMoreover, clause 30(1) says that federal legislation will apply to private organizations, even though they are under provincial jurisdiction, if the federal government does not recognize the existence of similar legislation at the provincial level.\n\nIf that is not interference in areas under provincial jurisdiction, I do not know what words to use to make members understand.\n\nBill C-6 will be a big step backwards for Quebecers with regard to the protection of personal information.\n\nQuebec's legislation says, in section 14, that consent to the disclosure or use of personal information must be evident, free, enlightened and given for a specific purpose.\n\nWith regard to consent, Bill C-6 puts the consumer at a disadvantage by stating, in various clauses, vague principles that open the door to interpretation.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have enough time to give a thorough explanation of what is wrong with this bill. In closing, I would like to remind members that this bill was introduced without any consultations with the provinces, that it encroaches on provincial jurisdictions and that it represents a step backwards for Quebec with regard to the protection of personal information.\n\nThe enforcement of this legally deficient bill in Quebec will create confusion. This bill is impossible to enforce, it is vague, it causes undue difficulties for Quebec businesses and considerably weakens the right of Quebecers to the protection of personal information.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I was going to say that I am rising on Bill C-54, but since the House was prorogued by the government leader, we have to redo our homework today. We also have to rename this legislation Bill C-6.\n\nIn spite of the three and a half months the government had to prepare an appalling Speech from the Throne, it begged for three more weeks, and this of course led to all the bills dying on the order paper; this is unfortunate since the consideration of these bills was, for the most part, quite advanced in the House.\n\nBill C-6 is sponsored by the Minister of Industry, the good member for Ottawa South in the federal capital region. When we watch this minister act, we sometimes ask ourselves if his judgment is failing him.\n\nThis is the same minister who, a few weeks ago, said of Quebec's minister Bernard Landry that it was stupid of him to have met the mayor of Boisbriand, where GM's plant is located. He said “Since there is a good dialogue between us, I will help you keep GM's plant”, when everyone knows full well that 95% of Canadian automobile plants are in Ontario.\n\nQuebec only has 5% of them, one out of 15, and the minister would like to close it down. The Minister of Industry would not even help us keep our plant and he has the nerve to introduce Bill C-6, which will violate Quebecers' intimacy and confidentiality.\n\nThe title of Bill C-6 reads in part “an act to support and promote electronic commerce”—everything is fine so far—“by protecting personal information that is collected, used”, etc.\n\nMembers can see how twisted and dishonest the government is. They changed the name of unemployment insurance for employment insurance. It means that you pay insurance policy and if your house burns down, the insurance company indemnifies you. In the same way, workers pay part of their wages to have protection against unemployment or lay off. The name of the plan was changed. Employment insurance was so much nicer!\n\nThe hon. member for Drummond knows perfectly well that only 42% of people who pay employment insurance premiums qualify for benefits when they lose their job. Why? Because eligibility criteria were hardened.\n\nThe minister of Industry tells us that he will protect the privacy of Canadians. If he treats the confidentiality of personal data the same way he treats Canadian workers, there are reasons to worry. The way he treated Bernard Landry, the vice premier of Quebec, shows that the man does not have an ounce of judgement.\n\nThe minister is so deprived of judgement that he acted unilaterally when he introduced his bill on personal data protection without waiting for the report of the very consultation committee he had created. I wonder how a man like him can be member of the cabinet. He created a consultation committee, but one week later, he went ahead without even waiting for the report of that committee. Isn't that bright?\n\nThere is even worse. On September 21st 1998, 13 months ago, he consulted the provincial ministers. A few days later, on October 1, he went ahead and introduced his bill, Bill C-54.\n\nI am not the only one, and the Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to object to the way the minister is behaving. In Quebec, his critics are unanimous.\n\nThere is the government of Quebec, the Conseil du patronat, the CSN, the Chambre des notaires, Options consommateurs, the Barreau du Québec-of which the member for Brome—Missisquoi was president. There was a by-election after Mr. Peloquin, who represented this riding, died. The member who has replaced him said: “I will go to Ottawa to defend the interests of Quebecers.” He was then president of the Quebec Bar. Five years later, his former association says: “Bill C-6 is garbage, it should be thrown out.”\n\nWorse yet, a group of constitutional experts said that Bill C-6 was in violation of the constitution. A little while ago, the member for Drummond said that in 1994 Quebec had passed a bill protecting personal information. In Quebec, we already have an act. A few years later, the federal government is getting ready to destroy, ruin, put the axe to something which is working well in Quebec.\n\nWe saw the same thing in the throne speech we heard two weeks ago. In Quebec we have a drug plan which is working well. The federal government now wants to create it own. Once again it is going to cause trouble in Quebec.\n\nThe Minister of Industry knows full well that in Quebec we have what we call civil law and in the rest of Canada they have common law. I would like to read section 3 of the Civil Code. It is very short:\n\n“Every person is the holder of personality rights, such as the right to life\n\nEveryone agrees\n\n, the right to the inviolability and integrity of his person, and the right to the respect of his name, reputation\n\nThat is, not saying anything against someone\n\nand privacy”.\n\nThis is section 3 of the Civil Code and it is from the latest volume that was just published.\n\nBill C-6 should be put in file 13, shelved and simply be cancelled. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, want that Bill-6 be simply withdrawn for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the Minister of Industry has tabled it without consulting the provinces. The bill would interfere with provincial jurisdictions. It would force Quebec to go backwards with respect to the protection of personal information, as the hon. member for Drummond argued so well earlier, because its enforcement in Quebec would produce confusion and because it is lacking on the legal level.\n\nFinally, it uses electronic commerce as an excuse to invade the civil right of Quebecers and of all Canadians.\n\nIn conclusion, I wished that the Prime Minister, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, would try to make the minister see reason, although I sometimes question his intellectual abilities, as he demonstrated about a week and a half ago. If he is not able to do so, he should get rid of him as Minister of Industry and kick him out of the cabinet.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise after my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic. I hope to be as eloquent as he was on the subject.\n\nLike my other colleagues in the Bloc, I am somewhat perplexed and concerned by Bill C-6. It concerns me because, as we all know very well—and my colleagues have mentioned this amply today—we already have in Quebec a law governing personal information, a law that has been enacted, works very well and covers the entire field, to the full extent of the law and the powers of the national assembly.\n\nSo, the law covers all areas of personal information, and now we have the federal government with another law, Bill C-6, which, in legal terms, is inadequate as it fails to cover all it should. In addition, it causes serious confusion in business and does not even protect individuals.\n\nMy colleagues have spoken at length of various aspects of the bill. I would like to focus for a few minutes only on the presentation made by the Quebec Conseil du patronat in March.\n\nIt is not a sovereignist organization. It in fact is known to represent primarily big business in Quebec and has traditionally been federalist in its political views.\n\nHowever, in the case of Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54, they came up with a very detailed report to show that this bill was totally unacceptable for Quebec businesses because, once again, it creates confusion.\n\nBill C-6 does not at all take into account the Quebec act, with the result that Quebec businesses will be subjected to two different legal systems.\n\nIn its presentation, the Conseil du patronat says that for information collected, used and transmitted in the province, the personal information protection act that will apply in the private sector will be the Quebec act, while the federal legislation will apply to information transmitted outside the province. This is only one of many factors that will generate confusion among businesses.\n\nThe Conseil du patronat provides a few examples. For instance, Quebec companies that come under federal jurisdiction and that do business outside Quebec, or that are governed by a Canadian act, will not know which legislation applies. Indeed, there will be two acts that will put contradictory demands on them and, moreover, that will not adequately protect people.\n\nThere is a jurisdictional conflict, with the result that Quebec consumers will not be properly protected, while businesses will have two types of remedy. This is a total contradiction. And these are only two examples provided by the Conseil du patronat du Québec.\n\nConsent is extremely important when we are dealing with personal information. However, the provisions in bill C-6, which is the federal legislation, and in the Quebec act are different.\n\nUnder the Quebec legislation, consent must be express, specific and clear. On the other hand, according to the principle set out in section 4, schedule 1 of Bill C-6, consent is required. There is one contradiction.\n\nThere are others, for instance the one concerning the collection of information. The Quebec legislation states that the collection of information from a third party cannot be done without the consent of the individual, except in certain very specific exceptional circumstances. Bill C-6 on the other hand states that an organization may collect information without the knowledge and consent of the individual.\n\nHow can anyone see his way clear through two pieces of contradictory legislation that are complete opposites in their vision and their application? It is certain that this does not protect the Quebec consumer but, worse still, it places Quebec businesses in an extremely unfortunate position, because they are incapable of knowing whether they should be treating their customers according to federal or provincial legislation. Things will be even more complicated for companies carrying on business with out-of-province companies or those coming under federal legislation.\n\nThere are many examples of these. However, I would conclude with a quote from the submission by the Conseil du patronat du Québec:\n\nThese are all questions for which we find no answers at this time, and if Bill C-6 is passed as is, they will mean huge problems for businesses.\n\nThis is one of the conclusions by a council that, I would remind you, is not a sovereignist organization. It is one that defends the interests of Quebec business people and often comes across as federalist.\n\nThere are so many questions raised by Bill C-6. That is, moreover, the reason I am so concerned. If the Conseil du patronat raises so many questions on Bill C-6, one may well wonder, given the potential conflicts and obvious contradictions, whether this bill is just an unplanned accident or a deliberate act by the federal government.\n\nDoes the federal government have the deliberate intention of adversely affecting Quebec with Bill C-6, not only in its law-making powers, but also by harming Quebec businesses? Is this a possibility? I ask you. Does the government deliberately wish to harm Quebec?\n\nIn the case of Bill C-6, we are justified to ask this question because it is big and obvious and because the contradiction is also obvious. I wonder if, basically, it could be deliberate. There is no lack of recent examples regarding the federal government and its actions against Quebec, whether against the social union or the provincial powers. We have seen it in the health sector; we have also seen it recently in the education sector with the creation of the millennium fund. What an insult for Quebec. The only thing that could be worst could probably be Bill C-6.\n\nThe federal government directly addresses the students on the issue of the millennium fund and even they are outraged to see how it shamelessly holds them hostage.\n\nIt does not try to harm Quebec in a hypocrite and hidden way. No, it does it in broad daylight. Once again, Bill C-6 is an example.\n\nBill C-6 is a good example of this attempt which is probably part of plan B, which is to despise everything that maintains the distinct character of Quebec, that is the privacy legislation for example.\n\nIn conclusion, as all my colleagues, I wish that the minister will finally wake up and have the good sense to withdraw this bill.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, he reminded us that Quebec has had a law since 1994, in addition to the Civil Code, which you have certainly had occasion to look through in your spare time. The member for Berthier—Montcalm, a lawyer himself, who studied in this city not far from the Hill, made the same point. He also told me, in confidence, that he has wonderful memories of the years he spent studying law.\n\nAnyone looking through the Civil Code will notice article 2, as the member for Frontenac—Mégantic mentioned, and articles 35 to 41. I should perhaps omit article 41, which talks about respect for the body after death, because this might give those who really want to do this bill justice some ideas. We will stop at article 40.\n\nIn my view, article 35 is the most important article in the Civil Code when it comes to respect for privacy. I will read it, because it captures the essence of what the legislator was trying to say about privacy. I will dedicate it to the government members.\n\nThe following acts, in particular, may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person: one, entering or taking anything in his dwelling; two, intentionally intercepting or using his private communications; three, appropriating or using his image or voice while he is in private premises; four, keeping his private life under observation by any means; five, using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public; six, using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.\n\nThe Civil Code is not a meaningless document. It is not the Liberals' red book. It is the very foundation of our legal system. We are, and I have learned this myself in my law courses, a province, a country—soon, let us hope—with a civil law tradition.\n\nWhat is the difference between civil law and common law. Let us say that, in common law, judges can make the law, although this could be harshly debated. In our system, legislators and parliamentarians give some direction in a legal system where everything is codified or pass specific legislation.\n\nWe have already passed a specific piece of legislation concerning the right of privacy. We led the way, as several of my hon. colleagues pointed out, and we cannot understand why the government is so eager to legislate in this area. Some people might find it easy to believe that I am too partisan, even though I can ensure everyone today as I have in the past that it is not the case.\n\nI think I have always been perfectly impartial and completely objective in this House, and to show my hon. colleagues that the point of view being supported by the Bloc members is not partisan, is not part of the Bloc agenda, I could share with the House the opinion of an authority that has always stayed clear of political partisanship.\n\nI am talking, of course, about the Quebec Bar Association. Has there been a more respectable institution in our society, a more neutral one, up until the day the former president of the bar decided to join the Liberal Party? But we like to think this is the exception to the rule.\n\nOn February 4, 1999, not that long ago,the Barreau du Québec, with its recognized legal expertise through its president, Mr Jacques Fournier, not only condemned the lack of vision of this bill, and questioned its rationale, but also pleaded for the Quebec legislation to be extended to areas of federal jurisdiction.\n\nI would like to read you something from Page 2 of the document:\n\n“To avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information, we submit that bill C-54 should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé, which is a Quebec law. We go further still, saying that, in our view, the bill should incorporate Quebec's act, even with respect to federal areas of jurisdiction, so as to avoid confusion, overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec.”\n\nI do not know if I should table the document so that it will be available to all parliamentarians. I am prepared to do so. But one thing remains: authorized people of the legal community, the main spokespersons of the lawyers, the president of the bar greatly wished that the Quebec legislation be extended. This is a paradox of this government.\n\nWhen we read the Speech from the Throne, we expected the government to budge in a number of sectors. I could give you the example of the air transportation sector. We expected the government to do something.\n\nRemember, there has been a cabinet reshuffle. The Prime Minister has recognized that there were quite a few jacks in this government and that he needed some queens. He then has called to the cabinet a number of women and we expected the government to do something. Even you, Madam Speaker, somewhat wished it deep down inside.\n\nWe expected the government to budge in the air transportation sector. We expected it to do something in the area of organized crime, on the issue of money laundering, for example. So many other areas should have retained the attention of the government!\n\nInstead of doing something in areas it was mandated to do something, the government intervenes in an area of pure civil rights tradition, thus compromising, as you can understand, the integrity of the powers of the national assembly.\n\nThen, we have no other choice but to oppose this legislation. All my colleagues will do so with as much determination as our critic for industry and we will fight this bill until it is withdrawn.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am very happy to rise on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to speak to Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54.\n\nThere are some in the Quebec society and elsewhere who are questioning the role of the Bloc Quebecois here in the House. Madam Speaker, as a representative of a Quebec riding, this is the perfect demonstration of the role played by the Bloc Quebecois in this House, which is, in addition to promoting sovereignty, to speak up for Quebec's interests.\n\nWhere are the other members from Quebec? Where are they? Let us imagine what would happen if we were still in the days of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, to whom people are still paying homage today. If out of 75 members in this House we had 74 sheep, as was the case for Quebec in those days, what would they be doing faced with a bill on personal information such as Bill C-6?\n\nIt is an obvious intrusion, undue and unbridled, on the part of a minister who is displaying a self-serving attitude we did not think he was capable of. As we will recall, he introduced this bill on October 1st 1998, only days before the opening of the OECD meeting on electronic commerce in Ottawa. The then industry minister, who is the same as today, was hosting the meeting.\n\nHe probably wanted to look good to his international counterparts, pretending he was concerned about the real issues in his area, probably to raise his profile although this was going against public interest.\n\nThere is a consensus in Quebec according to which the federal government should not intervene in the field of personal information, since this issue is quite well covered by Quebec's law. As my colleagues already mentioned it, it is the bar and the Quebec council of employers, among others, and not only us, who are saying it. These organizations asked the Government of Canada where it was heading with its project.\n\nThe bar, through its president, Me Jacques Fournier, wrote on February 14, to my colleague of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and said:\n\n“First, we are puzzled by the lack of correlation between the title of the act and its contents”.\n\nThis is what the president of the bar said. It is normally embarrassing for the government.\n\nIndeed, the bill has more to do with the protection of personal information in the private sector than with the promotion of electronic commerce.\n\nYet, the subject of the meeting was electronic commerce. But the government wanted to show itself in the best light. The same thing happens when terms are changed, as my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic said earlier. “Unemployment insurance” was changed by “employment insurance”. They are changing words to show themselves in a better light in front of the people.\n\nThe president of the bar continues to denounce the federal project by saying:\n\nQuebec's policy has been applied in Quebec for close to five years now. This policy is well known and businesses are accustomed to it”. Consequently, Quebec's bar essentially subscribes to the recommendation made by the information access commission, and I quote: “In order to prevent all confusion and to ensure that all Quebecers can continue to benefit from a complete policy in matters of personal information protection, we propose that Bill C-54 be amended by providing explicitly that the federal act will not apply to businesses already subjected to the Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector”.\n\nLet me continue quoting from the president of the bar:\n\nWe would go even further. We think the bill should be incorporated by reference in the Quebec legislation, even in federal areas of jurisdiction, in order to prevent confusion, overlap, and duplication of legislation in Quebec.\n\nWe have been condemning for 40 years this duplication between federal and provincial legislation that makes such a mess in our institutions. That is why we are trying to convince more and more people in Quebec that sovereignty is the solution to all these problems. We should get out in order to be in a better position to deal with the rest of Canada as equal partners.\n\nThe president said further:\n\nWe believe the Quebec plan for the protection of personal information in the private sector is better than the one in Bill C-54, now Bill C-6, particularly as concerns rights of appeal and efficiency.\n\nThe merits of the bill cannot withstand the serious examination made by the president of the bar or the Commission d'accès à l'information, which has a mandate to speak out, because we are dealing here with personal information.\n\nHowever, I have been particularly impressed by what I read from the testimony of the Conseil du patronat. This organization is a legitimate advocate for business interests. It certainly has more ties with the Council for Canadian Unity than it does with the Parti québécois executive, for example.\n\nThis organization has written a chapter that is as good as many sovereignist speeches. I will read it to you since I still have a little time left; it is absolutely beautiful because it shows, once again, the Canadian mess which becomes more and more institutionalized.\n\nIn the brief it submitted to the Standing Committee on Industry, the Conseil du patronat is critical of the communication of information.\n\nI quote the brief on page 5:\n\nBecause of the double jurisdiction, the companies falling under provincial jurisdiction will wonder whether the personal information which is collected from them and consequently protected by Quebec's legislation and which is transmitted to a company falling under federal jurisdiction and carrying business in Quebec will be governed by Quebec's rules or Canada's rules. In addition, within a single file, some information could be subject to both statutes.\n\nIt is easy to manage for someone who is in the private sector, who has to do business, who has to deal with a union, who has orders to fill and deadlines to meet—we know how complicated it is—and who is confronted with such legislation that clearly shows the existence of two solitudes.\n\nThe fact that nobody on that side of the House nor over there seems to be interested in this bill, with the exception of the Quebec's members, clearly illustrates the Canadian drama, the two solitudes, the fact that something is going wrong.\n\nSo, along the lines of Reed Scowen, the government is also addressing Canadians. Maybe the time has come for our country to reflect on where we are all going together. It might be better for each to proceed along its own solidly built road running in the same direction, rather than crashing head on and trying to gain the right of way in an area already governed perfectly well by provinces, and Quebec in particular with an entire culture behind it that is suited to this type of problem.\n\nNow to go on with the disclosure of information, again quoting from the brief submitted by the Conseil du patronat:\n\nWhat about the organizations whose activities are connected to federal jurisdiction, for instance loan companies and airports? One could even conceive of different rules applying to one and the same file, depending on whether the information collected, used or held is covered by Quebec or federal law.\n\nThis is a constant muddle.\n\nMoreover, any Quebec business with a branch in another province—such as an insurance company—that is required to send it information gathered in Quebec would have to know whether to refer to the Quebec or the federal legislation on protection of that information. Similarly, if the information in question is stored in a computerized data bank in Quebec but accessible by another company outside Quebec, which legislation would apply?”\n\nNow, coming to the conclusion of this chapter:\n\nThese are all questions for which we find no answers at this time, and ones that will pose huge problems to businesses if the bill is passed in its present form.\n\nThis then, is what the business people have to say, the language they use, and these are the ones responsible for added value in our society.\n\nWe ought to ask ourselves some questions when people like this speak up so courageously to government. Normally, they are on the same side. It is no secret that these are natural allies. But they are telling the government: “Stop, do not continue with this bill.” This is, moreover, the position of the Bloc Quebecois. It is an indefensible bill.\n\nInstead of spending his time on such a bill, the minister should be focussing more attention on the GM affair. He should quit behaving to the Quebec ministers as if he were an Ontario minister and abandon the scornful tone he uses with Quebec's deputy premier and minister of industry and commerce.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is rare for me not to be pleased to be part of a debate on a bill, as is the case today.\n\nThis bill, formerly Bill C-54, which was criticized by most of my colleagues, remains a bill that should be treated as the Bloc Quebecois proposes, that is, it should be set aside. The Minister of Industry should be sent to do his homework so that everyone is satisfied. To this point, one party is totally dissatisfied—Quebec.\n\nIt is unanimous in Quebec. Everyone opposes this bill on e-commerce and personal information. Why is everyone opposed?\n\nFirst, it is as a matter of principle. The federal government has an almost legendary propensity to meddle in jurisdictions other than its own. Every lead taken by Quebec in areas of its jurisdiction is penalized by the federal government with its wall to wall bills.\n\nOver the years, there have been fairly remarkable examples of this. In 1994, for example, we were all newly elected to our first term, and the Minister of Finance started talking about the appropriateness of establishing a Canadian securities commission. Securities are under Quebec's jurisdiction exclusively, and Quebec has worked very hard for the past 30 years to create an effective system with highly interesting areas of jurisdiction that are in fact higher than what is found in most provinces in Canada.\n\nBecause Quebec took the lead in the area of securities, in a field the Canadian Constitution recognizes as its own, the federal government decided, because the other provinces were not as well organized as Quebec, to establish a Canadian securities commission, wall to wall, with duplications, overlap and total confusion in this sector so vulnerable to uncertainty. The Minister of Finance paid no attention to the problems this might cause Quebec.\n\nThere are other examples, such as that involving provincially chartered insurance companies. Quebec had an inspector general of financial institutions, a Commission des valeurs mobilières to monitor transactions and minimize the risk for shareholders and insured persons. However, that did not stop the Minister of Finance from deciding a few years ago to prevent a provincially chartered insurance company from Quebec, L'Entraide assurances, from acquiring a block of insurance from a federally chartered company. The reason given was that it would create a precedent and other provinces would want to follow suit, although they were not prepared to do so.\n\nOnce again, with the levels of protection Quebec has introduced in the financial sector generally, and particularly in the insurance sector, we were penalized because the other Canadian provinces did not show the leadership that Quebec did in this area.\n\nIf we go back a little further, we will recall that Bill S-31, in the early 1980s, prevented the Caisse de dépôt et de placement from acquiring a large block of shares in Canadian Pacific. Once again, because Quebec had established an institution like the Caisse de dépôt et de placement starting in the 1960s, which was already a force to be reckoned with in the early 1980s, because Quebec had taken the lead, had opted for modern methods of managing the pension funds of Quebecers, it was penalized. The federal government wanted to stop Quebec from getting ahead, from modernizing.\n\nThe millennium scholarships are the same thing all over again. Every time Quebec moves ahead, shows leadership, as we saw with the millennium scholarships, because the other provinces have not put together a system like Quebec's—once again, a coast-to-coast policy—with the millennium scholarships, the federal government is ignoring the consensus in Quebec opposing this project.\n\nIn the case before us, it is the same thing. Quebec has had a personal information protection act for five years. That act works well, and everyone is familiar with it now, both the consumers, who can invoke its provisions, and businesses.\n\nQuebec's act protects not only personal information in the province, but also personal information that is sent by a Quebec business, for example, in other Canadian provinces, or personal information that is received in Quebec from other Canadian provinces.\n\nThis is such a good act that it enjoys unanimous support in Quebec. It is not perfect. All laws are, in a sense, imperfect. Legislation must adjust to evolving situations. But the Quebec act enjoys the unanimous support of Quebecers. It is a good act with a good middle of the road approach that pleases everyone and that includes provisions to prevent any leak of personal information.\n\nThis is so true that, as others have said before me, even the Conseil du patronat finds that it is a good act with which businesses can work, and with which they are now familiar, because it has been in effect for five years. Should Bill C-6 come into effect, it would create total confusion among Quebec businesses.\n\nIn fact, the Conseil du patronat refers to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec government in the area of personal information protection, as provided by section 92.13 of the British North America Act. The Conseil recognizes that Quebec has jurisdiction to legislate in that area.\n\nIt also feels that this bill will create confusion not only among businesses, but also among consumers, who will not know who to turn to, or to which legislation to refer to protect their rights and the information that concerns them.\n\nIn its brief, the Conseil du patronat said “As for Quebec consumers, they would always have to identify which act applies and to choose between two remedies, depending on whether the information is protected under one act or the other”.\n\nThis bill would create total confusion. It has been criticized since it was first introduced as Bill C-54. It has been criticized by everyone in Quebec and particularly by those who take an interest in personal information protection and in the civil code.\n\nAs others have mentioned before me, even the Barreau du Québec said that the best way to handle the situation—and one must think that nine Canadian provinces do not have personal information protection legislation—the only way to respect Quebec's choice and to avoid any harm to consumers and businesses who have been operating for five years under Quebec's act would be to enshrine in the bill a reference to that act confirming that it replaces the federal act on Quebec's territory and when personal information is exchanged between a Quebec company and a company from another Canadian province.\n\nThis proposal was made by the Barreau du Québec. It may be worth considering. As others have said, it is not that we hate the bill. We consider that it could very well be implemented in the nine other provinces but that, in Quebec, the choice made five years ago should be respected. This could be one of the flexibilities that people across the way like so much to boast about, particularly after the Speech from the Throne read by the Governor General.\n\nIt seems to me that that could be a good way to prove that the government wants to improve a little bit the functioning of the system. It may also be advisable for the government, after six years in office, to show that it can respect the choices made by Quebec and recognize that it was a pioneer.\n\nSince our first day here, we have been asking the federal government to take action in its own jurisdictions. For example, it was asked to take action in the transportation industry during the debate on Air Canada, Canadian Airlines and Onex. Just recently, we saw another example of the federal government refusing to co-operate in the transportation industry with the way Quebec's finance minister was treated by the Minister of Industry with regard to the restructuring proposal for the GM plant in Boisbriand.\n\nIt is being asked to take action in the area of public safety, an area under federal jurisdiction. It is being asked to fight organized crime, reform our tax system, and give middle income Canadians a substantial tax break as early as this year and this fiscal year. But it refuses to take action in these areas.\n\nIt always finds a way to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction. It creates conflicts, and the opposition always finds itself in an awkward position when it would have been so easy for the federal government to say that this bill will apply to the other provinces, with a reference to the Quebec legislation regarding the protection of personal information for that particular province.\n\nTherefore, for all these reasons, we will vote against this bill.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, everybody will understand that it is on a somewhat humble tone that I am speaking today to an issue of such a vital importance, after the many eloquent speeches from my colleagues. I am making reference, among others, to the members from St. Hyacinthe—Bagot, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, Rosemont, Trois-Rivières and Frontenac—Megantic. All those who rose before me are only adding, if you will, to my nervousness while I am speaking.\n\nYour attention to this debate and your nods of agreement while we speak are only adding to the determination with which I am expressing myself here today.\n\nOn October 19, 1999—a few days before the birth of the first child of a couple that are friends of mine and to whom I wish to say hello—we can talk about an obsession of the federal government, the obsession of uniformity.\n\nWe can only go back to the origins of this country, Canada, namely the Constitution Act, 1867. This document—until the fast approaching day when Quebecers will decide to leave democratically, and we are working passionately to that end every day—represents the rules we have to follow.\n\nThe Constitution, although plagued with defects was nevertheless sometimes reflecting a certain wisdom. All the colleagues who spoke before me mentioned that section 92.13 of The British North America Act gave the provinces exclusive power on property and civil rights.\n\nBut another paragraph which remained almost unnoticed until now in the Constitution is section 94. Section 94 allowed the federal government to ensure the uniformity of legislation in the common law provinces at a time when there were four provinces in Confederation, that is Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This allowed the federal government to standardize legislation in Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but not in Quebec, because it was recognized explicitly, not only in section 92.13 but in section 94 as well, that the legal system in Quebec was distinct, based on a totally different tradition, a civil tradition.\n\nThe recognition of the distinctiveness of Quebec's legal tradition is not upheld by those who want to be the heirs of the Fathers of Confederation, the current government.\n\nAny observer from another country, or even one landing here from another planet, would say “My goodness, this does not make any sense. The ones defending respect of the Constitution of 1867 are the sovereignists, the ones who want to ensure that Quebec is no longer bound by that document”.\n\nWhere are the defenders of federalism? Where are the defenders of the Constitution? They sit opposite, but say nothing. Even those who come from Quebec did not stand up to say “Wait a minute, we will not allow the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec to be flouted, put aside, forgotten, and even, as one my hon. colleagues put it so eloquently, scorned”.\n\nIt is of course the Bloc Quebecois' position that I just mentioned, but it is widely shared by numerous stakeholders throughout Quebec.\n\nOnce again, the Bloc Quebecois is the voice of Quebec in the federal arena, to the great displeasure of my colleague from Chicoutimi, whose speech I did not hear. I do not know if he rose to speak on this subject.",

            "text": "My colleague, the member for Chicoutimi, has not yet been heard. I hope that he will rise and, for once, defend the interests of Quebec in the House and that he will do so in a strong voice, with his friends from the Bloc Quebecois.\n\nI would like to quote Jean-Pierre Bernier, of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association. The last time I checked, that association was not exactly a supporter of the Bloc Quebecois. Mr. Bernier said:\n\nThere is a constitutional issue here, since personal information, in my opinion, comes under provincial jurisdiction, under the heading “Property and Civil Rights”. Therefore, I think it would be very difficult for the federal government to pass legislation dealing exclusively with the protection of personal information. If you are able to relate personal information protection rules to an area of activity where federal authority is not in doubt, you have more chances to occupy the field, if I may put it this way.\n\nThis is rather clear, but he is not the only one who thinks so. There is also Michel Venne, a well known and respected journalist in Quebec, who works for Le Devoir , the great newspaper founded by Henri Bourassa in 1910, the motto of which is “Do what you must”. We are doing what we must by opposing this bill.\n\nHe wrote: “The justice ministers of the provinces and the territories expressed strong concerns about significant invasions of provincial and territory jurisdiction found in Bill C-54—now Bill C-6. They asked the federal government to withdraw the bill and to consult the provinces and the territories. If the resolution passed in the House of Commons in December 1995 and recognizing Quebec as a distinct society by its language, its culture and its civil code meant anything, Mr. Manley should have provided for an exclusion for Quebec in the original bill”.\n\nThis is a quote, I am reading it. According to the Standing Orders of the House, we may name a minister.\n\nIn Quebec, there is unanimity against the federal bill. Why is that? Because in Quebec, who have been at the forefront of the area for years or even decades, well before we came to this place, the Liberal government of the day, with the support of the Parti québécois, put in place its own personal data protection system in 1994.\n\nThat clearly shows that even at that time, the issue escaped partisan politics that is normal in any democratic society. However, the bill passed by the National Assembly in 1994 was only one element of the legal interest for privacy protection that already existed in Quebec.\n\nAs was pointed out earlier by my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, sections 37 to 40 of the Civil Code already cover the protection of privacy and the Civil Code on which is based all the Quebec legal system is not to be swept aside.\n\nNot only that, but another document which has almost a constitutional value in Quebec, that is, the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, also protects privacy. Thus, the Charter, which was adopted in 1974, if I remember well, and the Quebec Civil Code, which has been adopted only recently—we were governed by the Lower Canada Civil Code between 1866 and 1992 or 1993, if my memory serves me right—all demonstrated how important the protection of privacy was for the Quebec legislator.\n\nWhat is this government doing? Without any consideration not only for the importance that Quebec had given to the protection of privacy but also for the unanimous opinion of Quebecers of all political colours, it has decided to interfere directly in this area. And it is doing it very awkwardly.\n\nI will conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government to withdraw this bill.\n\nI hope that Quebec's members from the Liberal Party of Canada will request the same thing. I hope I will have the opportunity to hear them speaking on this issue.",

What is the practicality of a national children's agenda without any commitment or target and real program to end the poverty of children and the families they are part of? What really is the national children's agenda when there is no sign of federal dollars for meeting the basic needs of housing in our society?\n\nThese questions are front and centre and remain unanswered after hearing the Prime Minister's response to the so-called national children's agenda. I wanted to get a clear answer and ask the Prime Minister directly if he understands that the so-called children's agenda is worthless unless it includes child care, especially as the Liberal government still has not fulfilled its promise for 150,000 child care spaces made way back in 1993.\n\nWhat are the answers to these questions involving the credibility and believability of the national children's agenda? All we got were excuses from the Prime Minister saying that the provinces had rejected the offers he made for child care. The Prime Minister is dead wrong. There is nothing for the provinces to reject because they were not offered any serious initiative that could be characterized as a national strategy and plan for an early childhood development program.\n\nWhere are we now? Federal New Democrats, the child care advocacy movement, the labour movement and provincial governments that are eager to see the federal government show real leadership want to see the Liberal government get beyond the platitudes of helping kids and get serious now with a national plan for child care.\n\nQuebec is doing it and B.C. is doing it. Why is the Liberal government not moving on this?\n\nKids cannot wait. New Democrats are saying to the federal government that if it is serious about ending poverty, if it is serious about the health and well-being of Canada's children, if it truly believes that Canada should be the best place to live for all Canadians, then it should end the vicious attack on Canada's poor, start building housing for families who desperately need it, make sure that the child tax benefit goes to all low income families and fulfil its commitments for child care spaces.\n\nIt seems like the Liberals are torn between two paths. It is tempted by the lure of tax cuts, peddled by business elites without offering any real help to low and moderate income families. While there are others within the Liberal caucus who know that after years of crushing cuts by their own government Canadians have as a first priority a reinvestment in programs and services that will help families.\n\nI implore the Liberals to not use the provinces as a smokescreen for their own inaction. I know B.C.'s minister responsible for child care, Mr. Moe Sihota, has gone very strongly on the record that he wants a comprehensive national plan for early childhood development and child care.\n\nPlease, do not blame the provinces. Just give us a straight answer. Will the federal government implement with the provinces a comprehensive national child care program?",

Raising the next generation of Canadians is everyone's concern and that is why we are doubling the EI period of parental leave. That is why early childhood development is a key theme in the national children's agenda.\n\nAs part of that agenda, we are committed to working jointly with our partners to develop an agreement on early childhood development by December 2000, an agreement with principles, objectives and fiscal parameters and a five year timetable for increased funding to achieve our shared objective.\n\nWe recognize that child care and indeed many services for children fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction but we have already made great strides with the provinces to improve the well-being of children. The centrepiece of our progress is the national child benefit. Thanks to the national child benefit, $2 billion will be going to modest and low income families with children by July 2000, bringing total federal assistance for families and children to almost $7 billion a year.\n\nThrough the NCB, provinces and territories are reinvesting in complementary services for children and eight provinces have already invested in child care. The member's own province of B.C. has had $80 million extra to invest in children, some of which they have chosen to invest in child care.\n\nWe, the Government of Canada, have also acted on our own through the First Nations Inuit child care program which has created or improved more than 7,000 child care spaces. Through the visions program, we are supporting research projects to improve the quality of child care across the country.\n\nThese initiatives are solid contributions to child care in Canada and the Speech from the Throne provides the potential to do much more.",

I pointed out the minister's record up to now: no moratorium, homes burned, businesses destroyed, neighbour fighting neighbour, 200 years of harmony between natives and non-natives jeopardized and the fear and uncertainty in this free for all continues as it does today.\n\nI asked the question: Can we expect more of the same from this minister, no leadership, no plan and no hope of a successful resolution?\n\nThere has not been a resolution to the problem and there could have been. Today there still can be, but the leadership is lacking.\n\nMy concern comes from lobster fishermen who are eighth and tenth generation fishermen. They remind me that today we have a healthy fishery, a lucrative fishery and a good fishery because it is well managed. Fishermen exercise good custodial rights, which is what we want to see in this ruling. There is no evidence that the minister is going to insist on that.\n\nToday in the lobster fishery we have trap limits. We have areas or zones in which fishermen can and cannot fish. They are designated areas or zones. We have a season and a limit on that season. We have a limit restricting entry into that fishery.\n\nFor many years there has been a limit on the effort in that fishery. That is one of the reasons this fishery has been very healthy and able to sustain many livelihoods over the past number of years. That is what the minister has to guarantee those people, that it will be there, that their livelihoods will not be destroyed by mismanagement of the fishery. There cannot be a wholesale entry into that fishery. They have to have some comfort from the minister as to when that will happen. That is part of the solution.\n\nWhen our livelihood is threatened we react. We understandably react sometimes harshly when we feel as though our way of life is going to be destroyed. That is what the non-native fishermen are experiencing at this very moment.\n\nWe want to see leadership from the federal minister. At some point, when this is all laid to rest, the word compensation has to enter the equation. If we have a fishery with no limit on the number of entrants, in other words allowing new players into that fishery, the entire fishery will be threatened. That is what I see happening. I think everyone on this side of the House can see that happening unless the minister takes strong, decisive action.\n\nPerhaps I could ask for another 30 seconds. I do not want to see the minister continually abdicate his responsibility—",
