The Saskatchewan senator died after a long fought battle with cancer. He lived a life marked by more than one personal tragedy, including the untimely loss of several close members of his family.\n\nSenator Balfour served on this side of the House after winning a seat in Regina as a Progressive Conservative member of parliament in 1972 and was re-elected in 1974. Under Joe Clark's government Mr. Balfour was appointed to the Senate in 1979 where he served for 20 years.\n\nHis tireless work on behalf of the people of Saskatchewan speaks for itself. Jim will be remembered both in his private and public life and the vast body of work he has left behind. He will greatly missed by all in the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\nOn behalf of the national caucus and leader of our party, I wish to extend my deepest condolences and sympathy to his family and to all those who knew him.",

Drug enforcement has the ability to seize cash, goods and property of smuggling rings. Yet immigration authorities are not awarded the same power. Proceeds of crime are there for smuggling drugs but not for people.\n\nMy bill, which would amend section 462 of the criminal code, would allow immigration to seize the profits of people smugglers. With any underworld activity it is difficult to catch the kingpins of smuggling operations. However it is essential that we allow the greatest amount of resources available in order to begin decreasing the financial incentives for such activity.\n\nTherefore I encourage all parliamentarians in the House to examine my bill. It is time we put an end to the large inconsistencies within the Canadian criminal code and go after proceeds of crime for all crimes.\n\n(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I move:\n\nThat the first report of the Standing Committee on Finance, which was presented on Friday, December 10, 1999, be concurred in.\n\nI have moved that the report of the Standing Committee on Finance be concurred in for the following fundamental reasons. We travelled across Canada and heard from many witnesses regarding the use of the surpluses—which do not belong to the minister but to all taxpayers—in the coming years. We in the Bloc Quebecois feel that a number of important consensuses have been completely ignored. I would like to discuss it here and I would like the report to be adopted after this speech. Let us take, for example, the social transfers. The whole issue of social transfers was debated in the finance committee and was raised by some of the witnesses. This question was fully discussed, as the Minister of Finance slashed social transfers.\n\nThe committee report does not even mention the possibility of employment insurance reform, even though it now covers only 42% of the unemployed.\n\nThey have also turned a blind eye to the recommendations made by my colleague from Québec on the fight against poverty in Canada. As for the issue of taxes, this major issue was minimized, yet the Minister of Finance has surpluses coming out of his ears.\n\nI would like to touch upon these issues in the next few minutes if I may.\n\nAs far as social transfers are concerned, since 1994 there has been a drop in federal transfers to the provinces for funding of social assistance, post-secondary education and health to the tune of $22 billion, $6 billion for Quebec alone.\n\nThe report by the Liberal majority in the finance committee ignores these cuts and their devastating effects on the poverty level in Canada and the situation in the health system.\n\nI would also like to point out in passing that since 1994 Quebec has absorbed 37% of all cuts to Canadian social transfer funds for post-secondary education, health and income security while accounting for only 24% of the population of Canada.\n\nThis has had disastrous results for Quebec. It has had harmful effects on Quebec public finances as well. There is a parallel to be drawn.\n\nBy slashing social transfers to the provinces, the Minister of Finance has hurt Quebec. A few years back, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs made a number of statements to the effect that it was necessary to hurt Quebec economically.\n\nThat brings me back to the bill recently introduced by the same minister. This is a bill against Quebec and against Quebecers. It is a case of one Quebecer going after Quebecers. This Quebecer can now act in collusion with the Minister of Finance, another Liberal member from Quebec.\n\nWe now have a very unusual alliance that really hurts the province of Quebec, an alliance between the Minister of Finance, who fiddles with the figures, and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who fiddles with democracy.\n\nThese two devious individuals can now rely on 24 other Liberal members from Quebec, 24 docile Liberal members who are ready to crawl on their knees in front of English Canada in order to hurt Quebec. It is a sad thing because throughout history there have always been individuals who agreed to fight against their own people, to do the dirty work for their leaders.\n\nThere are 26 such individuals in front of the House, 26 Liberal members from Quebec who have agreed to spit on Quebec and to deny Quebecers the freedom to decide their own future. They typify docility at its worst, kow-towing to their masters and conquerors.\n\nIt is a good thing we can count on the 45 members of the Bloc Quebecois. It is a good thing that we can count on these members to unconditionally defend Quebec, its national assembly and the freedom of its people and that we are not in the same situation as in 1982 when we had 74 Liberal members from Quebec in this House who supported the unilateral patriation of the constitution initiated by Mr. Trudeau. They ignored the national assembly's near unanimity against the unilateral patriation of the Constitution.\n\nWe, in the Bloc Quebecois, will stand up to fight on behalf of Quebecers for their right to freedom, to freedom of choice, and their right to democracy, a healthy democracy the government is trying to tarnish in this House with the complicity of 26 Liberal members from Quebec who are willing to help the English Canadian majority do its dirty work.\n\nThe report of the Standing Committee on Finance's Liberal majority is also weak in that it makes no reference to employment insurance, as I said in my introduction.\n\nPeople came to tell us that EI eligibility requirements have become so restrictive that it is virtually impossible for 58% of unemployed workers, who pay premiums when they are not unemployed, to receive EI benefits.\n\nSome people also came to tell us that as unemployed workers they were considered as abusers and cheaters and that they were harassed day after day and treated as if they were criminals.\n\nThis government has become the government of chronic and institutionalized impossibility. Again, I want to make a parallel with the bill introduced by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to establish a framework for the Quebec democracy.\n\nFor example, the bill provides that following a referendum in Quebec the House of Commons, which is made up of a majority of representatives from English Canada, will determine whether there is a clear majority of Quebecers who support secession. To that end, the House of Commons will take into account the “size of the majority”. Will there ever be a majority large enough to be acceptable to this government? No.\n\nThe Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs even repeated today that, whether the question is clear or not, the federal government will not allow Canada to be broken up.\n\nWhat is the point of tabling a bill requiring clarity when the government will not recognize the result of a Quebec referendum, even if the result is clear?\n\nThe bill also refers to the percentage of voters who will have voted and to any other matters considered to be relevant. This provision really opens the door to a very broad interpretation which will ultimately make it impossible to recognize the result of a Quebec referendum.\n\nThe bill also provides that the views of the political parties and the Senate be taken into account. Can you believe it? Senators would be consulted to give their opinion on a democratic process when they are not even elected? This bill is truly Kafkaesque and the end result is that it will be impossible for the House of Commons to recognize the referendum result.\n\nIt provides that the House of Commons will take into account any other relevant views on the majority. Are they going to ask Howard Galganov, Keith Anderson, Guy Bertrand and, while they are at it, Youppi, for their opinion on such an important issue, an issue that has to do with the free and democratic choice of Quebecers to create an independent country? This makes no sense.\n\nIt bears a strange resemblance to the way the EI system has been run for two years. What we heard in the Standing Committee on Finance was that the government disqualified most people who normally should have received benefits. The government is going after unemployed workers.\n\nHere again the situation is similar. First, the government goes after unemployed workers and then it goes after all voters in Quebec. Their right to choose is being taken away. The exercise of democracy in Quebec's referendums is being devalued. Quebecers are being treated like children, as are unemployed workers when they are monitored day after day and identified, almost as though they were setting out to cheat the system. It is becoming ridiculous.\n\nThere is another similarity between what witnesses had to say about the EI system and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs' bill.\n\nPeople told the committee that they were viewed by the system and by those enforcing it across Canada, based on decisions made here in the House, as cheaters. This is another big similarity with the bill introduced by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville.\n\nThe Liberal members accuse unemployed workers of defrauding the system and now, with the bill introduced by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, they are assuming and insinuating—and this is serious; members should listen carefully to what I am about to say—that all Quebecers are doing the same thing with democracy. Government members are insinuating that Quebecers are not playing by the democratic rules.",

They have become the leaders of what is becoming more and more like a banana republic, who are all excited at the prospect of crushing those whom they still consider the “white niggers of America”, to borrow the expression of Pierre Vallières.\n\nI have a bit of news for them. The Quebec people are too proud to stand for such treatment. The Quebec people are too proud to allow themselves to be crushed. They will stand up against this with the help of the Bloc Quebecois here in this Chamber.\n\nIn order to be certain that my message is properly understood I will quote, if I may, two excerpts in English from statements made by René Lévesque in May 1980 after the Quebec referendum and by Robert Bourassa after the failure of the Meech Lake agreement.\n\nRegardless of the result... it is now undisputed and indisputable that Quebec constitutes a distinct national community able to choose its constitutional status for itself, without outside interference. This right to control their own national destiny is the most fundamental right the people of Quebec possess.\n\nThat is the end of the quote from Mr. Lévesque's statement of June 11, 1980, after the first Quebec referendum.\n\nAfter that came the failure of the Meech Lake agreement, in which considered Quebec as something very minor, a distinct society, but rejected totally by Canada. Not only was there the death kiss of Clyde Wells and the actions of the present Prime Minister, but Canada too rejected this minimal agreement. In economics we say “minimum minimorum”, and there is nothing smaller than that.\n\nHere is what Mr. Bourassa had to say after the failure of Meech.\n\n“English Canada must clearly understand that no matter what anyone says or does, Quebec is and always will be a distinct society that is free and able to control its own destiny and its own development”.\n\nThose are the words of Mr. Bourassa. In other words, Quebec alone will decide its future and neither the people across the way nor the English Canadians are going to come and tell us how to vote in the next referendum on sovereignty.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister is faulted for this, he who has been involved in dirty dealings with Quebec since the beginning of his political career, that little guy from Shawinagan, the member for Saint-Maurice, he always comes back with the same quote, which we have heard a good 40 times in the 6 years we have been dealing with him: only the weak resort to insults.\n\nI agree with him on that, and I would point out that if that is so then he must be very weak indeed. Do you know why? On five significant occasions during his political career, this man insulted millions of Quebecers. He insulted them all.\n\nFirst, in 1980 Quebecers were told that to say no to the referendum on sovereignty was to say yes to renewed federalism. We found out later on what it really meant. It was a pack of lies. This man was involved in this first fight against Quebec's legitimate aspirations.\n\nThen in 1981 there was the night of the long knives. Taking advantage of the absence of Quebecers, especially Mr. Lévesque, the current Prime Minister plotted against Quebec in the kitchens of the Château Laurier Hotel together with representatives of other provinces—it has been called the night of the long knives—to isolate Quebec, to hurt it again. Already they were talking about unilaterally patriating the constitution. This was the second insult to Quebecers.\n\nThe third insult came in 1982 when the Canadian constitution was indeed patriated in spite of the nearly unanimous opposition of the national assembly. This was yet another insult to Quebecers.\n\nIn 1990 there was the failure of Meech Lake. The other day I heard the Prime Minister say “I was not there”. Negotiations were going on and this charming gentleman was standing in the corridor talking on his cellphone to Sharon Carstairs, the then leader of the opposition in the Manitoba legislature, who was fighting tooth and nail against the Meech Lake accord.\n\nA few weeks after the failure of Meech Lake, he embraced Clyde Wells. I do not know if he embraced him for reasons other than his fierce opposition to the Meech Lake accord and his crusade against Quebecers. If so, he should tell us.\n\nIn 1997, during the referendum on sovereignty, he organized an extraordinary love-in saying once again “Quebecers, you will be recognized if you vote no to sovereignty”. What happened since 1997? They still spit on Quebec and people across the way still work against Quebec. The same man is once again insulting millions of Quebecers.\n\nFinally, in December 1999, this month, the little guy from Shawinigan found the worst insult possible by putting seven million Quebecers under some form of custody, under mandatory supervision, as if they were cheaters, dishonest people whose enlightened choice of sovereignty was a crime.\n\nHow weak must the Prime Minister be to resort to such measures. As the old saying goes: insults are the weak man's weapons. Since the beginning of his political career he has constantly insulted millions of Quebecers.\n\nConsidering this bill in light of the way parliament and the governor in council operate and thinking of the influence enjoyed by the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime Minister himself, we have to ask ourselves if this man is a megalomaniac. Is it possible for such a man, under our current political system, to have exceptional power and a veto on the future of Quebecers, on the future of a whole nation?\n\nIt is the Prime Minister's office that decides. This means that under this process, under this bill that sets so many strict criteria for recognizing the result of a referendum or the clarity of a question, it is the Prime Minister, the little guy from Shawinigan, who will decide the future of seven million Quebecers. This cannot be. I cannot believe that we have reached that point in Canada, that we have practically become a banana republic, that the destiny of a whole people will be determined by one person.\n\nOnce again we have news for the Prime Minister. He may think and do what he wants but he will never prevent Quebecers from controlling their destiny, from choosing in a free and democratic way. There is nothing more democratic than the election and referendum process in Quebec. These people will not decide for Quebecers.\n\nThere are rather interesting things, particularly in international law. Among others, there is the 1975 Helsinki charter signed by former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. What does that charter say? It says that participating states, those that signed the charter, including Canada:\n\n—respect the equal rights of peoples and their right to self-determination, acting at all times in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nBy virtue of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, all peoples always have the right, in full freedom, to determine, when and as they wish, their internal and external political status, without external interference, and to pursue as they wish their political, economic, social and cultural development.\n\nThe participating States reaffirm the universal significance of respect for and effective exercise of equal rights and self-determination of peoples for the development of friendly relations among themselves as among all States; they also recall the importance of the elimination—\n\nCanada signed that agreement and we are lucky enough to have not only that charter but a whole series of international laws that make it easier for people to achieve sovereignty. In Quebec, we are also lucky to have 44 Bloc Quebecois members who, contrary to the 74 federal Liberal members elected in 1982, will stand up and fight against a government that has the audacity to deprive Quebec of its freedom and to restrict its democratic spirit.",

As I said, it is unfortunate that throughout the history of mankind some people have knowingly collaborated with the conquerors against their own people.\n\nWe have the same situation right now in Canada: 26 Liberal members from Quebec agree when the intergovernmental affairs minister and the little guy, the very little guy from Shawinigan, the Prime Minister, introduce a bill limiting the freedom of choice of Quebecers and preventing them from going through a normal democratic process that has been used many times in the past.\n\nDo members opposite think democracy is lacking in Quebec and that Quebecers are flouting democracy? These 26 Liberal members from Quebec seem to think so. If this is not what they think, if they believe Quebec will abide by the democratic process and that the national assembly will ultimately be responsible for the referendum question and the interpretation of the results, they will not support this bill.\n\nThe foreign affairs minister keeps repeating that he is working very hard for Quebec. He yelled to members of the Bloc Quebecois that we are exaggerating, that we do not speak the truth, that Canada should have its say in the decision on Quebec's political and constitutional status.\n\nIt is unfortunate that 26 Liberal members have joined forces with the English speaking majority in Canada to deny their own people the right to choose legitimately and democratically the future of an independent Quebec.",

When the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that, whether the question is clear or not, he does not want Quebecers to decide democratically on sovereignty, what is the point of introducing a bill?\n\nIt is not the question and its outcome that bother the government, and particularly the little member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. What bothers him is the content. What bothers him is the possibility that Quebec might become a sovereign country.\n\nBesides, that man has changed his mind. Here is what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs had to say in 1994. He said that the 1995 referendum was sufficiently clear.\n\nStill in 1994, he added “Ottawa's insistence on using the term separation in the question has no basis in law”.\n\nThe third thing he said, again in 1994, was “Ultimately, the terms sovereignty, independence, separation and secession are synonymous”.\n\nToday he tells us “We will consider the clarity of the question, the terms used, so that they are the real terms, secession, the breakup of Canada”. If these are not scare tactics, I do not know what is.\n\nLet us be frank. This is what is going on on the other side of the House, as we have seen and as Quebecers will see as we bring all this out. Let them admit that they have just sold out Quebec, that they are going to prevent it from using a democratic process to attain its independence. Let them admit it. That is the real purpose of this bill. This is the beginning of the pre-referendum campaign and the scare-mongering. They are telling Quebecers that they will not have the backing of the law if they answer this question.\n\nWhat is even sadder, and we saw this recently, is that during the 30-day period after they have forced the question out of the national assembly, they will debate the clarity of the question when Quebec is already fully launched into a referendum campaign.\n\nYes, it is sad. We will be right in the middle of a democratic process and these people will be imposing a process on us that smacks of apartheid.",

He has seen the outcome of provincial elections in the Atlantic region: three Tory governments out of four. He sees the polls in Ontario. He sees the relatively good showing of his long time enemy, Mr. Clark, who is certainly doing better in the polls than one year ago.\n\nWould my colleague agree with my analysis, which, albeit superficial, is logical? That strategy reminds me of the declaration the Prime Minister made two weeks before the 1997 election, when he talked about 50% plus one. I say this for the benefit of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time we lost several ridings to the Bloc in Quebec. I suspect the Prime Minister is now using exactly the same election-minded strategy and is thinking “I need at least 40 Bloc members in Quebec and 60 Reform members in western Canada so that we can squeeze through with 38 or 40% of the vote”.\n\nI have a feeling this bill was introduced for very practical reasons and not for reasons relating to the referendum.",

When the government starts to drop in the polls, the best way to raise its popularity quotient, in Canada in particular, is to dump on Quebec and Quebecers. Heaping scorn on Quebecers is the right approach. The more a Liberal member dumps on Quebecers the higher the Liberals go in the polls.\n\nI agree with my colleague. Probably he too looks at the polls relating to the Bloc Quebecois members and the rise in popularity of his leader, which has gone up constantly for the past year and a half. This I think is what motivates him to get tough with Quebec and to continue the dirty tricks he has always been up to.\n\nI have referred to the patriation of the constitution. He was there. The Prime Minister, that little little guy from Shawinagan, was there. He is the one who cooked up that procedure one night at the Chateau Laurier, a concerted effort by the federal government and nine Canadian provinces to crush Quebec, to marginalize it, to strong-arm it.\n\nHe was also, along with Mr. Trudeau, behind the unilateral patriation of the constitution in 1982, despite the near unanimity of the national assembly against it. Then there was Meech, as I have said before. Though he says “I wasn't even there for Meech”, that is not true. We were here. We walked around. We saw the Prime Minister in a corridor with his cellphone, and Sharon Carstairs, one of his buddies, was there working against the accord.\n\nHow about Clyde Wells, the embrace—and I am not familiar with the habits of the Prime Minister—but yes I agree with the hon. member.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, in a way, I thank the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for launching this very important debate on the direction we want to give to the year 2000 budget.\n\nI would not necessarily agree with the points he made in his opening comments and there was some digression later in terms of the clarity bill. But on the question of transfers, Canadians are clear that Quebec gets its share of the federal transfers, in fact more than 50% of the equalization payments. That is what this House is about. That is what this debate is all about. That is how democracy works.\n\nIt is my privilege and pleasure to lead off today's debate, a debate addressing what will likely be one of the most important budgets in modern Canadian history. This happy chore has been given to me by the finance minister.\n\nThe finance minister is in Berlin chairing the inaugural meeting of the G-20, a body dedicated to strengthening and stabilizing the world's financial architecture. The minister has asked me to express his thanks and appreciation to the hon. members of the finance committee for their committed efforts in what was truly a national odyssey to hear the views of Canadians and for the quality of that work in synthesizing and reporting those views.\n\nToday's debate is another important stage in the process of prebudget consultation introduced by this government. It is a process that many today take for granted. Let us remember what a dramatic change it represents compared to earlier decades when budgets seemed to be prepared in not so splendid isolation from the public and the emphasis seemed to be on backroom bartering rather than on public discussion and debate.\n\nMany members of the House have had prebudget consultations and town hall meetings in their ridings across Canada. I hosted a prebudget consultation in my riding of Etobicoke North on October 21. A large number of my constituents came forward to present their views on this very important budget. They told me that they wanted a balanced approach. That was the opinion of the constituents in my riding and I look forward to the debate on the budget 2000 by members in the House of Commons.\n\nTo help set the stage for this debate, I remind all hon. members of some of the important elements of our current economic and fiscal performance. It is these elements that set the context in terms of opportunities and also real limits for the 2000 budget.\n\nAs the minister reported to the committee in his fall economic and fiscal update last month, our national economy is strong with one of the best growth rates among the G-7 major industrialized nations and a number one record for creating jobs.\n\nThese results are due in great part to the fact that we were able to put our federal fiscal house in order. The time when we ended up with a deficit and an increase in our public debt year after year is over. For two years in a row now, we have had a surplus, something we had not seen since 1951-1952, almost 50 years.\n\nThe government is committed to maintaining this record of fiscal responsibility as the unyielding foundation for all policy initiatives.\n\nLooking ahead based on the average of forecasts by a group of Canada's leading private sector economists, this record of annual fiscal surpluses should grow from $5.5 billion in 2000-01 to $23 billion in 2004-05. This is a well deserved dividend that Canadians have earned through their support of the tough fiscal choices we had to make in bringing Canada's books back into balance. Of course those are impressive numbers but we must never let them tempt us into losing sight of the need for continued financial probity and prudence.\n\nAs the minister said to our committee, we live in a volatile global economy. Offshore events can buffet us overnight, sharply reducing future revenues from today's planning basis. That is why the government is sticking with the advice of the leading economists we consulted with and using real caution in our planning projections. This includes deducting our yearly $3 billion contingency reserve and a significant prudence factor before we arrived at those surplus estimates.\n\nWhile the update does offer a five year forecast for discussion and planning purposes, we should and we will continue to take budget decisions only within a rolling two year time horizon. This is something I hope hon. members will address in the debate to come.\n\nIt was through near term and real term targets that we made a reality of deficit elimination. That is how we can ensure that the government does not commit long term financial resources today for tax cuts for important national investments, popular as these may be, at the risk of a return to punishing deficits in years to come.",

            "text": "Never again.\n\nThat being said, I am sure most hon. members will agree that there are actions that must be taken, investments that should be made to strengthen our economy and provide Canadians with the prospect of better incomes, a higher quality of life and increased security and opportunity.\n\nThe committee's report highlights some excellent suggestions, but let me note that two of the commitments that this government has already acted upon, debt relief and tax relief, are a critical part of a context for the upcoming budget and for today's debate. First, we will continue to reduce the debt load on the economy and its taxpayers. Second, we will continue to reduce taxes.\n\nIt is a fact that we have already made some headway on our national debt.\n\nThe last two years, with the debt decreasing by some $6.4 billion, we were able to save more than $300 million in interest every year.\n\nAnd there is more good news. We have actually paid down debt previously borrowed in financial markets by almost $16.4 billion. These achievements in combination with sustained economic growth also contributed to the reduction of the debt to GDP ratio. This ratio assesses our debt according to the size of our economy.\n\nIn 1995-96 that ratio peaked at 71.2%. In other words, our debt was equal to nearly three-quarters of our entire yearly economic output. For 1998-99 that ratio was down to 64.4%. This marks the third consecutive annual decline in the debt to GDP ratio.\n\nBy the way, there is another important comparison that should be highlighted. If one uses comparable accounting standards, our federal fiscal turnaround, combined with the positive fiscal performance of most Canadian provinces, means that on a total government basis Canada has achieved the largest improvement in its fiscal balance of all the G-7 nations since 1992.\n\nLet me emphasize to all hon. members and all Canadians that such fiscal improvements are not abstract accounting achievements. Combined with our commitment to low inflation, they have contributed directly to keeping interest rates down. Gone are the days when Canadian rates were axiomatically higher than U.S. rates. In fact our rates are generally equal to, if not lower than, American rates.\n\nBut Canada's financial challenges are not over. We have to stay on track and that includes getting our debt burden down further. Five years ago 36 cents out of each federal revenue dollar went to pay interest on the debt. However because of our financial progress the portion of each revenue dollar eaten up by interest charges is down to 27 cents. That is progress, but it is still too high.\n\nThis is money that could otherwise be used to cut taxes, or for health care, or for investing in knowledge and innovation. For this reason we are continuing with our debt repayment plan.\n\nWe will continue to include every year in the budget a $3 billion contingency reserve. This will ensure that the government will be in a position to fulfil its obligations toward Canadians without ending with a deficit because of some unforeseen economic hardship. If the contingency reserve is not needed it will be applied to the debt.\n\nPaying down absolute debt is only part of our strategy. We will continue to make important investments in strengthening our economy, such as boosting our national research capability and boosting knowledge, skills and training. The dynamic at work here is clear and concrete. The combination of a shrinking debt and a growing economy work together to make the burden of debt fall faster. Just like a family with a mortgage, the more one earns and the more one pays down, the lighter the load.\n\nIt is this consistent strategy of falling debt and a growing economy that will help Canada and Canadians build a foundation for success in the 21st century.\n\nThis takes me to the second firm commitment I want to highlight. That is continued tax reduction. With the end of the era of deficits and growing debt, our government has moved to cut taxes for all Canadians. Quite simply, people have the right to expect that each year we will bring down taxes. It is not a matter of debate. Tax reduction is essential to secure strong and sustained economic growth. We may debate the means and the pace, but from the point of view of our government, reducing taxes is not a debatable item.\n\nWhat is more, we have taken some actions already. The actions taken in the 1998 and 1999 federal budgets have removed 600,000 low income Canadians from the federal tax rolls. The combined actions taken in the last three budgets mean that the personal income tax relief for Canadians will total $7.5 billion in 1999-2000. That is about 10% of all personal income taxes. For families with children, total personal income tax relief provided in the last three budgets represents an average of 16% reduction in their tax burden. That is families with children.\n\nWe are going to do much more. This process continued the day of the minister's update presentation itself when we announced that for the sixth year in a row, employment insurance premiums will be reduced from $2.55 to $2.40 for each $100 of insurable earnings starting this January 1. This means that employees and employers will save a further $1.2 billion next year, bringing total savings, compared to the rate that prevailed in 1994, to $5.2 billion.\n\nLooking beyond that, as the Speech from the Throne and the fall update both emphasized, in the 2000 budget we will spell out a multi-year plan to cut taxes further and we will explain how we intend to carry it out. This plan will be based on a number of key principles.\n\nOur approach must be fair which means starting with those who need it most: middle and low income earners, especially families with children. We will focus initially on personal income taxes, since that is where we are most out of line. We will also have to ensure that Canada has an internationally competitive business tax system. Finally, we will not finance tax relief with borrowed money because that just means an inevitable return to higher taxes in the future.\n\nSuggestions on how best to implement further tax reduction and by how much are important elements of the finance committee's report.\n\nI know that the minister and his team are studying the report very closely. I congratulate the chairman and all members of the Standing Committee on Finance for such a comprehensive and detailed report.\n\nI know the minister will be very interested in the ideas and criticisms that each and every hon. member can add in the House today. I encourage my hon. colleagues from all parties to provide their own positive, concrete suggestions.\n\nI hope my few remarks have put some of these issues in some context, but I am sure we will not agree on everything that should go into the year 2000 budget. However, it is a process that is respected and it is very worthwhile having the debate in the House of Commons because budget 2000 will likely set the tone and thrust for Canada's continuing growth and security in the new millennium.",

A survey showed that 54% of Quebecers think this is the top priority. The second choice got 17% or 18%.\n\nShould this not be the first thing to consider when deciding how to reinvest the federal government's surpluses? Another measure urgently required is to really make the employment insurance system an income supplement so as to put a stop to the impoverishment being inflicted by the federal government on all regions with seasonal industries, particularly in Quebec. That would ensure that the income of someone who is employed 20, 22 or 23 weeks per year is not less than it was in 1994 before the Liberals came to power.\n\nShould those two measures not be taken expeditiously by the federal government to try and correct the impoverishment the Liberals have brought about through their budget measures and decisions thereby strangling the provinces and the unemployed?",

Equalization gives Quebec $2.8 billion more over five years, and Quebec now receives about half of the money available in the equalization fund, or about $4.5 billion per year.\n\nIn last year's budget, the government injected $11.5 billion into the CHST for health care and Quebec was a recipient of that. Whether the CHST should be augmented further is a very debatable point, which is the purpose of this discussion.\n\nWith respect to the question around employment insurance, Canadians understand and appreciate that the government had to take some very decisive action on this. Would everybody in the House agree that every measure we took was perfect? Would everyone in the House agree that perhaps there are some adjustments that need to be made? Perhaps.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and speak on what has become, with very short notice, the prebudget debate this afternoon. Having said that, I am pleased to stand and represent not only my constituents but also my party on this issue.\n\nThe first concern I have with the majority report that really reflects the position of the government members on the finance committee is that I feel that some of the recommendations in it are completely insincere. I want to expand on that.\n\nThe first point is that there were headlines after this report was leaked. Sadly, it was leaked, as it always is, and as we have seen with so many different committees over the last few years. The headlines indicated that the majority report was calling for about $46 billion in tax relief.\n\nRepresenting a party that has long called for major tax relief in the country, I certainly do not object to the majority report of the finance committee calling for big tax relief. We favour that completely. We believe that one of the greatest errors the government has ever made was to continue to raise taxes. It has hurt Canadian taxpayers tremendously.\n\nHowever, we doubt the sincerity of that recommendation. The reason we doubt the sincerity of the recommendation is that a few paragraphs into the report we see the government claim that it wants to continue to adhere to the 50:50 promise.\n\nFor people who do not know what the 50:50 promise is, let me explain. In the 1997 election, the government made a promise that surpluses that ran up over the next several years would be divided; about 50% to new program spending and the remaining 50% to a combination of tax relief and debt reduction.\n\nThe government laid out the numbers in the fiscal and economic update in November when the finance minister told Canadians that the total surplus, best case scenario, would be $95 billion, and that the amount we could count on to use for things like spending and tax relief would be $67 billion. In that situation, it means that the finance committee report was calling to spend $46 billion of that on tax relief, leaving very little for its huge commitment to spending increases.\n\nThis is obviously a bold attempt by the government members to have their cake and eat it too. They want to be the champions of tax relief saying “Oh, we believe in tax relief, but on the other hand, we believe in raising spending dramatically. We want to see 50% of the surplus devoted to new spending”. They also care very much about the debt. They want to see debt repayment become a huge priority as well. They cannot have all of these things at the same time, but that is exactly what this report attempts to do.\n\nSo we very much doubt the sincerity of government members when they claim that this is what they want to do. These two things are simply incompatible. They contradict one another. We think it reflects very poorly on the whole report. We think it undermines the credibility of the whole report.\n\nStarting from that very flawed approach, we think that the report, while having some merit in some areas, is also found lacking in many others, but the most glaring area is really the one I just mentioned.\n\nI want to expand on that for a moment. This is a pattern that we see coming forward from the Liberal government. On one hand it promises that it wants to have tax relief. It promises that will come at some point in the future, but its rhetoric and its record show something completely different.\n\nWhen we heard the fiscal and economic update from the finance minister at the beginning of November he talked ad nauseam about why we need to have lower taxes in Canada today. However we find out through the government's actions that it is raising taxes.\n\nThe best example is the millennium tax hike which will occur just two short weeks from today on January 1. Canadians will wake up from the big millennium party with a big tax headache because on January 1 in the new millennium, the year 2000, they will see all kinds of tax increases.\n\nLet me recount some of them for the House. We will see Canada pension plan taxes go up as part of the largest tax increase in Canadian history. It is a double burden for the self-employed because they have to pay both halves of that huge 73% hike in Canada pension plan taxes. The government is saying that taxes are going down and that it wants taxes to go down, but at every opportunity it raises taxes.\n\nThe second example is how it is increasing personal income taxes. The government never misses an opportunity to say that it would never raise the tax rate. The government is being completely honest when it says that, but it is being somewhat deceptive when it alludes to only the tax rate because the overall tax burden will go up because of bracket creep.\n\nEver since 1986 when we deindexed the tax system in Canada under the previous Conservative government we have seen taxes increased automatically for hundreds of thousands of Canadians every year, without having a vote in this place to decide whether or not we should have an increase in taxes. It is an automatic tax increase. The government benefits from that because it brings in about $1 billion a year in new revenue.\n\nI want to touch for a moment on the rhetoric of the government when it comes to how concerned it is about people on the low end of the income scale. Interestingly enough, people on the government side have made a career of telling the public how much they care about people who are struggling to get by, the people who have fallen through the cracks. Yet those people who have fallen through the cracks, the people on the low end of the income scale, are hurt more than anybody else in the tax system because of bracket creep.\n\nIt is interesting to note that every year 85,000 new taxpayers join the tax rolls because of bracket creep. They do not have any more purchasing power. They do not necessarily get a raise but they are dragged on to the tax rolls for the first time.\n\nWhy is that? It is because with every passing year not only are the tax brackets not indexed but also because the exemptions are not indexed. People end up losing the value of the exemptions which become less and less with every passing year due to inflation, due to the increase in the cost of living. These people are dragged unwillingly and unwittingly on to the tax rolls and start to pay taxes for the first time.\n\nAs the Liberals have been in power for the last six years they have increased revenue from people on the low end of the income scale, and indeed from all Canadians, by billions and billions and billions of dollars. This is a big tax increase that the Liberal government has pushed through and presides over. We never discuss it and never have a vote on it in the House of Commons, but nevertheless Canadians are much the poorer for it. That is one way in which the government continues to raise taxes.\n\nOn January 1 there will be another tax increase. This is another way that the government raises more revenue and people are less better off, without having a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nLet me give one more example, for instance, the small business exemption. Small businesses in Canada have an exemption of $200,000 below which they pay one rate of tax and above which they pay another rate of tax. That will also be eroded by inflation this year, so small businesses will see their taxes rise again through the big hike in Canada pension plan taxes and through the erosion of the exemption for small business. That is another way.\n\nThere are other examples which I could go into. My point is simply that the government on one hand says it is concerned about taxes and it is cutting taxes, but at every opportunity it raises taxes. That is what we will see on January 1. Its say one thing but does something completely different whenever it has a chance.\n\nHow does this hurt Canadian families, Canadian entrepreneurs and Canadian investors? There are different ways in which it has hurt them. The best way to bring that home, as we have tried to do over the last several weeks, is to recount the stories of many Canadians who sent us their paystubs to illustrate to the finance minister and to the government in the clearest possible way what happens to people's incomes when taxes are as high as they are.\n\nLet me remind members of an issue I brought to the floor of the House a few weeks ago. I had a teacher from my riding send her paystub which showed that she had received a $1,000 raise, but by the time the taxman got done with it, $81 of the $83 a month raise was gobbled up.\n\nI know it sounds incredible, Mr. Speaker, and you look incredulous, but I can tell you we saw the paystub. We shared it with the media. We had Annalora Horch, the teacher from Medicine Hat, go to the bookkeeper of the school board and ask what was happening. The bookkeeper said that it simply reflected the tax tables for Alberta issued by Revenue Canada as of July 1, 1999. They were following exactly what the government told them they had to do. The result is that a $1,000 raise becomes a $24 raise, thanks to the tax increases of the government. We think that is terrible.\n\nThe member for Edmonton North raised the issue of Doreen, a worker from Winnipeg. Doreen sent us her paystub, her statutory holiday paystub. She had received statutory holiday pay of $53, which is a small amount, but she was really concerned that $30 or 60% of that $53 went to pay taxes. I think that is ridiculous. I remember at the time the finance minister sort of mocked this. It is a small amount of money, I will agree, but every dollar is precious to people who are hard pressed and paying the highest taxes they have ever paid in Canadian history.\n\nIt is ridiculous that on the one hand we have the government saying it wants to reduce taxes but on the other hand we see taxes mounting ever upward.\n\nI want to raise the instance of Andy. Andy is a mechanic in my riding. He works at Evergreen Implements in Brooks. He works in the town where I live. He has been a mechanic there for 27 years. He sent us his Christmas bonus paystub which showed that out of his bonus the finance minister got 42%.\n\nAndy, Doreen and Annalora are the ones who are putting in the extra hours. They are the ones who are working their hearts and guts out for their families. They take all the risks. They do all the work, but who gets half the bonus? Who gets half the statutory holiday pay? Who gets half the Christmas pay? It is the finance minister.\n\nIf that is not the biggest destroyer of incentive I have ever seen, I do not know what is. It is ridiculous that to burden our people the way they are in Canada. They should be rewarded for hard work, productivity and entrepreneurship but sadly they are punished.\n\nWe must remember that taxing something effectively means that we get less of it. A tax is a price. When a tax is placed on something we get less of it. The higher jobs are taxed, the fewer jobs we get. We see that with every passing year as Canada pension plan taxes go up, or when employment insurance premiums do not go down nearly as much as they should.\n\nI remind the House that the government is still raiding or confiscating $7 billion a year of employer and employee premiums that do not go to pay more benefits and therefore should come back to employers and employees in the form of lower premiums. The government continues to raid that and as a result we see the taxes on jobs being far too high.\n\nWhen we have high income taxes we have a high price placed on productivity and work. There is no incentive to work overtime any more. We wonder why we languish when it comes to productivity. The reason is that we pay a very high penalty when we work hard in Canada today.\n\nWhat about entrepreneurship? There are myriad ways that the government punishes entrepreneurs. I have recounted some but I will go into that in a bit more detail. Before 1971 in Canada we did not have a tax on capital gains. Since that time we have an extraordinarily high tax on capital gains. The result is that we put a high price, a penalty really, on the great crime of investing in our economy.\n\nOne thing that has distinguished Canadians over the years is that people have been risk takers. We have been individualists to some degree. That may shock some people in the Chamber, but we have been rugged individualists. We have said that we wanted to create businesses, to start something that we could run ourselves and be our own bosses. As a result of the high capital capital gains taxes in Canada today, it is very difficult to accumulate capital to the point where we can start a business. The result is that many people leave the country.\n\nThe best example is what is going on right now in the high tech industry where we see all kinds of people who are trying to start businesses moving to the United States and other countries around the world. That is shameful.\n\nNot only is it a shame to lose these people because of the economic impact, but we see families splitting up, families leaving the great country of Canada to go elsewhere. That is disgraceful. It is very disappointing to see the government be so sanguine about it, especially the Prime Minister who says “If you don't like our high taxes then just go to the United States”. I think that is ridiculous.\n\nWe see it in other ways, even in consumption. The more consumption is taxed, the less consumption we have. That is rather obvious. For retailers in Canada that is a serious issue. Not long ago I spoke to Peter Woolford, head of the Retail Council of Canada. Mr. Woolford pointed out in testimony to a Reform Party committee that the domestic economy in Canada had never really recovered from the recession of the early 1990s. One reason for that is the high taxes on consumption. We see this at the provincial level and at the federal level. Part of the reason is that people have less disposable income and therefore cannot purchase in the first place.\n\nWhenever we have these taxes we have what economists call a tax wedge, a difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what the seller is willing to sell for. The tax often serves as the wedge so no deal is struck between the two. The result is that a sale is not made. We need to make sales. We need to keep the economy moving for the economy to grow, to create wealth, prosperity, jobs, opportunity and hope, something for which Canada was known during the first 100 years of its existence but too often is no longer known for.\n\nThese are all prices that are placed on very productive behaviour. Now we in Canada bear the fruit of that in the form of a brain drain and an unemployment rate that is still far too high. The unemployment rate is about 60% higher than it is in the United States. It is certainly 60% higher or perhaps higher in relation to the historical level of employment in Canada. That is a huge concern. Government members take some comfort in an unemployment rate of about 7%, but to the unemployed it is not very much fun at all.\n\nThere are other ways in which the government punishes people through the tax system. In 1995 when the finance minister undertook a number of changes he asked that Revenue Canada hire a whole bunch of new auditors. The impact has been terrifying for people who are in the sad position of having these people visit their businesses. Let me cite an example.\n\nOne accountant in my hometown, Hugh Bevan, writes to me often about something that is so bizarre, but it makes sense because it is about government. If a farmer or a rancher buys a half-tonne truck or a three-quarter tonne truck with an extended cab, a log has to be kept indicating everywhere the truck travels. The reason is because somebody might be in the back of the truck who is not actually travelling on official business. This results in farmers and ranchers being forced to keep a log. With all of these compliance costs, people try to cheat the system and get around these things in various and sundry ways.\n\nThis is not productive. Instead of trying to wring every cent out of Canadians' pockets, when will the government make a solid commitment to cutting taxes, not some airy-fairy commitment that is contradicted in the document itself, such as we see in this finance committee report?\n\nCanadians want lower taxes. Fairness and justice demands it. It is time the government quit talking about lowering taxes and started doing it instead of giving us tax increases like we will see on January 1.\n\nLet us end this Liberal rhetoric. We want to see lower taxes in Canada starting today. Therefore, I would move that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after “That” and substituting the following therefor: “the first report of the Standing Committee on Finance, presented on Friday, December 10, 1999, be now concurred in, but that it be recommitted to the Standing Committee on Finance with instruction that they amend the same, so as to recommend that the government re-index the income tax system to inflation by immediately eliminating bracket creep”.",

The official opposition has called for major tax relief. We will outline the size of our proposed tax relief in our January report”.\n\nI draw to the attention of the House the tax package that the House of Commons committee tabled. It is very important to understand its major components. I cite the fact that the finance committee would like the government to adopt the following plan over the next five years. First, to increase the basic and spousal amounts by 15%, which would mean that the basic personal amounts for individuals would rise to $8,200. This measure would take 500,000 Canadians off the tax rolls. It would lower the number of people on welfare and increase attachment to the workforce.\n\nSecond, we want to reduce the middle tax rate by three percentage points to 23%. This is in large part because hard-working, middle class Canadians worked so hard to defeat the deficit and give the Canadian government a surplus that they need to be rewarded.\n\nMr. Speaker, I will not cite the entire passage because you are signalling me to stop.\n\nI want the hon. member for Medicine Hat to tell Canadians whether the figure in the Reform package will be over the $46 billion in tax cuts announced by the finance committee.",

We see it also through the homeless situation, where because of high taxes and excessive regulation the stock of rental housing has not increased.

More money is going into health care in both Alberta and Ontario than has ever gone into health care in those provinces, thanks to the provincial governments. On the other hand, we have the Liberal federal government, the supposed defender of medicare, cutting the life out of medicare, cutting ultimately $21 billion out of medicare.\n\nWe can thank Mike Harris and Ralph Klein for helping health care recover at the provincial level.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to rise today to present and debate Motion No. 222 on seasonal workers and the employment insurance.\n\nThe motion reads as follows:\n\nThat, in the opinion of this House, the government should take immediate action to restore Employment Insurance benefits to seasonal workers.\n\nThe debate on this votable motion is an opportunity for my colleagues and myself to thoroughly look into the issue of seasonal work and try to find short, medium and long term solutions.\n\nI introduced this motion in order to demystify seasonal work. People who work in seasonal industries are often called seasonal workers. We often forget that they are not seasonal workers; their jobs are seasonal.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to introduce this motion is the recent changes to the employment insurance plan. Through this debate, I want to highlight the negative impact of these changes on the lives of people who work in seasonal industries and of their families.\n\nI want to highlight the important contribution of these workers to our country and our economy. But most of all, I want to engage my colleagues in an exchange in order to develop solutions that will certainly include a proposal to reform the employment insurance, but also proposals to diversify our country's seasonal economy.\n\nFirst, it must be mentioned that seasonal work is very important for the Canadian economy. It accounts for one million direct jobs and contributes to the creation of thousands of others. A number of industries are seasonal by nature. A case in point are the industries which are weather-dependent such as fishing, logging, agriculture, mining, construction and tourism. There are other industries such as the automotive industry, education, and cultural industries.\n\nSeasonal industries are an important variable in Canada's balance of payments. Net exportations of agricultural products, seafood, energy and mainly wood products are the main elements in Canada's balance of trade.\n\nThe tourism industry is the 12th largest economic sector.\n\nIn 1995, shipments by the construction industry were estimated at $22.8 billion. That year, the building materials industry accounted for about 6% of the gross domestic product from manufacturing and it provided direct jobs to nearly 150,000 people across Canada.\n\nIn 1996, the forestry sector contributed $20 billion to the Canadian economy. Activities in this sector accounted for 2.9% of the GDP. In 1997, national forestry exports were estimated at $38.9 billion. Moreover, in 1997, the forestry sector provided 365,000 direct jobs.\n\nAs for the commercial fishery on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, it was valued at $1.6 billion in 1997. Fisherman from the Atlantic provinces are responsible for 74% of that amount.\n\nLooking at these statistics, it is obvious that seasonal industries are important to our economy throughout the country. All these sectors make an important contribution not only to our economy but also to our quality of life.\n\nPart time university professors contribute to the education of our young people but their work often depends on university semesters.\n\nWho does not appreciate a nice lobster, especially here in Ottawa? We often tend to forget that before reaching our plate lobster had to be harvested by a fisherman and packed by a plant worker to be shipped to Ottawa.\n\nTourism is another example. A canoe rental business can hardly find clients in the middle of winter when rivers are frozen. Therefore, it provides work to its employees only 10 or 12 weeks out of the year, during the summer months.\n\nSeasonal jobs are dispersed throughout Canadian industries. Their contribution to the Canadian economy goes far beyond the activity that is confined directly to the seasonal jobs themselves.\n\nIn the forestry sector for example, the harvesting of trees leads to primary sector activity in sawmills, pulp and paper, and plywood and panel board plants. Secondary manufacturing includes planing mills, engineered wood products, manufacturing of paper or cardboard products, wood re-manufacturing, prefab homes and wood doors and windows.\n\nSeasonal activity in forestry generates year round activity in many more sectors.\n\nIn 1995, a working committee was set up to examine the issue of seasonal work and employment insurance. Its report contains findings that in my opinion are still valid today.\n\nFirst, it draws attention to the fact that what is seasonal is not the workers but the jobs. Second, the committee found that the contribution of seasonal labour to the Canadian economy was largely ignored.\n\nFurthermore, it noted that a negative attitude toward seasonal workers was emerging and that these workers were considered responsible for the temporary nature of their jobs.\n\nFinally, it warned the Liberal government of the day that any change to employment insurance would disproportionately affect seasonal workers.\n\nThe government had in its possession a document that said what exactly the impact would be on seasonal workers but it chose to go ahead anyway.\n\nWhat is the situation today? The eligibility criteria are too high and prevent many seasonal workers from receiving employment insurance benefits.\n\nIn addition, the government decided to punish workers who frequently claim employment insurance by making them subject to the intensity rule.\n\nThe committee was right to say that the government had a negative attitude toward seasonal workers.\n\nInstead of attacking seasonal workers, the employment insurance reform should have taken into account their particular conditions and created a system reflecting the reality of the labour market.\n\nSeasonal work is a subject of special concern because those engaged in seasonal work have fewer alternatives than other workers and are therefore more dependent on EI. They cannot fish when the bait is frozen or cut trees in the spring thaw when roads turn to mud. Very often, workers in seasonal industries live in remote areas of the country where the only work is seasonal and things freeze up in the winter.\n\nThe working group has also predicted that the EI reform would have a negative impact on women. In many cases, women who work in fish plants are unable to meet the number of hours of work requirement to qualify for EI.\n\nWith the EI reform, the number of hours required to qualify has doubled in certain areas. Besides, the 910 hours required from newcomers on the labour market or from workers who have been away from the labour market for a time result in the exclusion of many women and young people.\n\nThis 910 hour requirement penalizes women who have decided to stay home to raise their children during their formative years. When they go back to work and the seasonal work ends, they do not have any income because they cannot meet that 910 hour requirement.\n\nWhy did the government choose to make those changes if it knew what the impact on women would be? Perhaps because it wanted to use the surplus accumulated in the EI fund thanks to all those restrictions to reduce the deficit and the debt.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have talked about the rise in the number of children living in poverty. It is not hard to realize that the EI cuts have deprived mothers and fathers of benefits, and that their families suffer because of that.\n\nSince many poor families are headed by single mothers, the fact that women do not qualify for EI has contributed directly to the increase in child poverty. The saddest thing of all is that this negative impact was very likely intentional\n\nThe EI reform has had a negative impact on seasonal workers. This impact was predicted and can be observed today.\n\nIt is time to admit that errors were made. It is time to make changes so that seasonal workers can again qualify for EI premiums.\n\nBut the government must not stop there. I am often accused of suggesting EI as the solution to all problems. That it not true. Really.\n\nWhat must be remembered is that the EI program is there to help workers who have, through no fault of their own, lost their job. It is a temporary measure to help during the transitional period, but this government is forgetting that this temporary measure is necessary for both workers and for the economy. When workers are denied EI premiums, small and medium size businesses suffer too.\n\nEven the Liberals agreed with us. In 1993, when the Prime Minister was the leader of the opposition, he said:\n\nBy reducing benefits and further penalizing those who leave their jobs voluntarily, the government shows very little concern for the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of getting to the heart of the problem, it goes after the unemployed.\n\nWhat happened to our Prime Minister? Perhaps the same thing that happened to the red book, the GST and all the rest.\n\nThe Prime Minister went on to say:\n\nThese measures will have a disturbing impact.\n\nIs it not ironic that when he came to power our Prime Minister did exactly what he spoke out against? He went after unemployed workers and the result was very disturbing.\n\nThe Prime Minister was not the only one to oppose relentlessly the proposed changes to employment insurance. On July 31, 1989, my predecessor, Doug Young, said that the taxpayers of New Brunswick should vigorously oppose these changes, which would have serious consequences on the region.\n\nI am prepared to give credit to the Liberals. They understood the situation before taking office in 1993. They knew that employment insurance was an important program that was part and parcel of the social fabric of our country.\n\nI even believe that they know now that they are wrong. But the employment insurance fund is accumulating a surplus of $7 billion every year and they do not want to give up what this surplus brings them. As I said before and continue to say, workers are the victims in this case and this is unacceptable.\n\nMy hon. colleagues opposite sometimes point out to me that workers are abusing the employment insurance program. But the workers are not the ones dependent on the employment insurance system, the Minister of Finance is. He cannot do without it and he relies on it.\n\nBut to talk about employment insurance is not good enough. The problem with seasonal industries is that we do not think in the long term about the diversification of the economies dependent on these industries.\n\nSeasonal work is found mainly in rural areas where natural resource development is the main activity.\n\nIt is not that people do not want to work. It is a situation where once their working season comes to an end, be it in forestry, the tourist industry, fishing or construction, there is no other work to be had.\n\nThus, apart from giving them access to the EI program, we must also invest to ensure economic diversification.\n\nToo often these communities harvest the resource. For example, in communities like Caraquet, Shippagan, Lamèque, Bouctouche and Cap Pelé in New Brunswick, fish is caught and then sent to Japan for processing.\n\nWhy not do the processing at home? Why should we not do secondary and tertiary processing? Why do we not develop aquaculture, which could represent the future of fisheries?\n\nHowever to develop such industries, we need a long term vision that builds on the experience and the know-how of all the players, investors, workers, community groups and elected officials, whatever their political affiliation.\n\nFor too long now Atlantic Canada has suffered because of decisions based on political motives rather than on the best interest of the communities. This has to change. We cannot go on like this.\n\nThe Liberals will have to stop giving away money only to their friends and start looking at the real economy and the way to develop it. What they are doing is the way things were done by politicians a century ago. It has to change. We have to work together to change things. We cannot go on like this. We need a long-term vision on how to develop the economy of our country and of our rural areas. As long as we do not do it, we will be missing the boat. We will be missing the boat and a great opportunity. We have to recognize the difference between rural Canada and urban areas.\n\nWe need to invest in our infrastructures so that our rural communities can become as competitive as our urban centres.\n\nAgain, in my province of New-Brunswick, the natural gas pipeline runs from Sable Island to the south, but does not go to the north. How do you expect northern New-Brunswick to compete with the south when the infrastructures serving these two areas are not the same?\n\nBesides investing in the infrastructures, we have to invest in people. We have to give them some training. Not just any kind of training, but training in the industries that are liable to develop in their region.\n\nWe have to try to improve access to training. In order to diversify the economy, we need to provide the workers with the support they need to get jobs in the new industries.\n\nThe working group, in looking at the seasonal worker and employment insurance, said:\n\nWhat is lacking in many areas dependent on seasonal work is the infrastructure to make diversification possible, for example:\n\nCore infrastructure such as transportation, telecommunications, basic services such as water, electricity and waste disposal;\n\nAccess to research institutions with the corporate-government and university liaisons and the means to develop and market research ideas;\n\nAccess to education and training institutions, both the buildings and the hardware and software to reach rural communities;\n\nAccess to financial institutions to bridge the financing requirements at a reasonable cost for start-up companies and companies in need of restructuralizing, rationalizing or expanding.\n\nIn other words, we need some planning. We have to determine which regions rely on seasonal work and then develop strategies based on their specific needs.\n\nWe have to remember that seasonal workers are here to stay. We will always want to eat lobster and need lumber to build our houses.\n\nWe have to stop penalizing seasonal workers and try to find solutions to extend the working season in the communities that rely on seasonal work.\n\nWhile we wait for medium and long-term solutions, we need to make the EI benefits more accessible by reducing the number of working hours needed to qualify.\n\nWe have to stop hurting seasonal workers. We have to get rid of the intensity rule. And lastly, we have to increase the benefit rate to 60%.\n\nI have submitted my short, medium and long-term solutions to the seasonal work problem and I look forward to hearing your suggestions.",

In fact his speech reflected the need for infrastructure, the need for development of industry, the need for greater attention to the economy of those areas and, above all, the great advent of technology.\n\nGreat strides have been made in the province of New Brunswick, both with the previous two premiers and our new premier who was elected last summer. We hope he will be able to follow in the footsteps of the previous two premiers.\n\nTonight I want to mention that employment insurance is not simply a relationship between the government and the workers of the country. It is a three way relationship. Employers pay into the fund 1.4 times the amount put in by employees. We have to ensure that it is a joint fund administered by the government of the country. There has to be a relationship among employers, employees and the government.\n\nThe fund was changed in the early 1990s and again in 1995-96. There are certain points we all must be concerned about. The hon. member brought out a good number of those points in terms of women, the intensity clause and seasonal workers about which we are so much concerned.\n\nTonight we should salute people who work in our seasonal industries. We talk about the people needed in the basic resource based industries such as fisheries, agriculture, forestry and other sectors. About 40% of the country's total gross domestic product in terms of exports is from basic resource based industries. We have to be sure the seasonal workers who participate in those industries are looked after adequately.\n\nThe intensity clause is one of the most difficult. Many members on this side of the House are concerned with the definite penalty against people who participate in seasonal industries.\n\nAs the hon. member indicated, an employee draws from the program for 20 weeks. Each time he draws after that he is penalized by 1%, going down eventually to 50%, which is a direct attack upon people who are mostly involved in seasonal industries. We too are concerned about that penalty or that intensity clause.\n\nThe employment insurance program has many good parts to it. For example, I mention Nova Scotia which has a very good program for people at the lower end of the economic scale. Families earning less than approximately $27,000 a year can receive a family supplement which will amount to approximately 80% of their earned income. That is a definite, positive aspect of the changes made in 1996.\n\nWe must also look at some government programs in terms of attempting to look at areas in need of more employment. We think of the former transitional jobs fund and, more specifically today, the Canada jobs fund. I see in the House tonight a number of members from New Brunswick. I think all of us from New Brunswick benefit from the Canada jobs fund.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I appreciate the concerns my NDP colleague has brought to the House. It is truly a very important issue that needs to be addressed by the government. We will go along and take some second thought on the amendment. I am not sure that it is an adequate response to the problem of the incomes of seasonal workers. I will relate some of the reservations I have about it. I acknowledge that it is an important issue and the member is to be commended for having raised it in the House this evening.\n\nAs was already said, it is a given that we have the reality of seasonal work in Canada. Certain businesses and industries in Canada have seasonal ups and downs regardless of the business cycle which means that fewer workers are needed at predictable times of the year. The result is that workers in those industries will apply for benefits at predictable times of the year on a repeated basis year after year.\n\nSeasonal work is a reality in Canada, perhaps more so than in other countries because we have so many resource based industries compared to other countries around the world. As has been brought to our attention by the two previous speakers, the problem we have before us and the reason the motion is here today are because of the 1995 act and how it has affected seasonal workers. That is the reason we are debating this motion today. Seasonal workers are getting less in the way of benefits as a result of those changes to the unemployment insurance program introduced by the 1995 Employment Insurance Act.\n\nThe government member who spoke prior to me referred to the intensity rule which the act introduced. That rule in its first time coming into effect distinguishes between frequent and infrequent recipients of benefits under the EI program.\n\nFrequent users of EI receive reduced benefits based on their previous use of the EI program. They are reduced by 1% when 20 weeks of benefits have been collected and may go as low as as 50%. They are not wiped out altogether but there is a significant 5% reduction depending on the frequency of previous claims. The lowest possible rate of 50% is in contrast with the standard rate of 55% for regular claimants. That has had an effect on real people, on Canadians, those who work in seasonal industries in Canada.\n\nThe 1998 EI monitoring and assessment report produced by the Department of Human Resources Development acknowledges that communities with high levels of seasonal employment were more likely to have industries that showed declining benefit levels.\n\nWhat did the government intend to happen? What was the motive of the government in all of this? What did it hope to accomplish by means of this intensity rule?\n\nIt would seem that it hoped workers would move out of seasonal industries and seek employment in industries where they would be able to be employed year round. The reasoning is pretty simple. Since seasonal workers would get less in EI benefits, they would be in a position where they would seek employment that would not be seasonal, that it would have that effect upon them.\n\nSeasonal workers are not doing anything different despite what the government assumed at that point. Unfortunately it did not have that effect on a wide scale. Most seasonal workers, at least during the time of the study that led to the 1998 monitoring report, said that the intensity rule would not affect their work patterns. That is their plain statement on the matter. When asked about their plans, they said that they had few employment opportunities outside of their existing seasonal jobs and that they would remain with their existing employment and continue to apply for EI despite the intensity rule.\n\nThere may be some different ways to deal with this but I do not believe we should go the route of what has been proposed today by my colleague from the NDP. There are arguments for leaving EI as it is if that is the only solution or proposal on the table.\n\nFirst, Motion No. 222 would move EI away from pure insurance principles which the Reform Party supports for the employment insurance program. EI is supposed to protect workers against—and I underline it—the risk of “temporary involuntary unemployment”. The member who introduced this motion mentioned that, but I think we need to get the context here and underline that it is for those where there is risk and it is temporary and involuntary.\n\nIn the case of seasonal workers we are not talking about risk, will I or will I not. They well know that come that certain time of year, they will be laid off. There is that predictable pattern of unemployment. For this reason EI as an insurance program based on insurance principles is really compromised when workers come back year after year at the same time of year for benefits.\n\nEI no longer functions as an insurance program, but rather it is a wealth distribution program. That is not to say that wealth distribution is not appropriate during a transition phase, but that is perhaps another debate for another day.\n\nMy point here is that the EI program as it was originally intended and as I quoted here would not be honouring true insurance principles if we used it to address the problem of seasonal workers.\n\nThe report of the Forget commission on UI stated on page 60: “Although it transfers money from the employed to the unemployed and to some degree from the rich to the poor, unemployment insurance is not a very effective income redistribution program”. There are other ways of doing it if that is our intent.\n\nSecond, Motion No. 222 would subsidize certain industries but not others. Companies that lay off workers at the same time every year have a huge benefit if those workers do not move away to find work elsewhere but stay in the area, collect EI and then are available to return to work when that work season begins again. This in effect means that such companies are being subsidized by the EI program.\n\nIf such companies were forced to pay higher premiums than other companies, then things might be fairer. Those companies might also be motivated to extend work seasons to avoid those higher premiums. That might be administratively difficult, I acknowledge.\n\nThird is why we should stay as is as opposed to the motion of the member, unless there is some other proposal on the table. We do have an amendment to which we will have to give some thought and consideration. Some seasonal workers have not been as affected as regular workers by the 1995 changes. That needs to be brought to our attention.\n\nNeither of the previous members made note of the fact that some seasonal workers have not been as affected as regular workers by the 1995 changes. In fact, the hours based system has actually helped some seasonal workers who work longer than the average hours per week, which is often the case with seasonal work. They work from sunup until sundown. They work long hours and they get lots of hours in over a short period of time. They are thus able to qualify for benefits in a shorter period of time. On the other hand non-seasonal workers who tend to work normal hours were not helped by the switch to the hours based system as some seasonal workers were.\n\nFourth, I would maintain the status quo or at least the present system as opposed to the motion under discussion here, because changing the rules for seasonal work might create an incentive for people to enter seasonal industries. We usually hear of the person who already has a seasonal job, but what about the person looking for a first job or looking to make a job switch? They might be more tempted to try to get a seasonal job than a long term employment option if they know that EI will supplement their income. Clearly we want some incentive in place that will make a person prefer the non-seasonal yearlong job. We need to have that in our EI program.\n\nCan we affect seasonal patterns? I think to some extent we can over the course of time. Seasonal patterns themselves have changed over time. During the 1970s, seasonality in employment declined somewhat, primarily in the primary industries mainly due to the decline in the size of the agricultural sector relative to the rest of the economy.\n\nSeasonal variability in unemployment has declined even more. In 1966 the difference between unemployment in the highest and lowest months was 46%. By 1980 the difference had declined to less than 26%.\n\nWe might ask how a government would go about affecting work patterns. One excellent proposal is that of experience rating. A fundamental reform which could help us is a proposal by Professor Jack Mintz contained in a taxation on business report. He talked about experience rating which relates to insurance premiums. This is used in the United States in cases where an insurance scheme penalizes those companies which lay people off more than the industry average. This is relevant to our situation today.\n\nIn a situation where there are many seasonal employees such as the forestry industry, a pulp and paper outfit which lays off more than the norm in that particular industry would see its premiums go up. This would create a disincentive to lay off people.\n\nA couple of years ago I was struck by a situation in a Wal-Mart store in Maine. It hired a number of people before Christmas and then laid them off normally, but it hired people to do a variety of other things and kept them on in the long term.\n\nWe should pursue these types of possibilities in some of our other seasonal industries. It is doable. We need to use some creative minds in terms of our approach so that we go after experience rating as a possibility for seasonal workers.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for his motion. I think that the issue of seasonal workers is a real concern.\n\nThis is the third year of the intensity rule which penalizes seasonal workers, taking away 1% of their benefits every time they receive employment insurance benefits for 20 weeks. This means three years during which, in our ridings, the Liberals have condoned the unfair treatment of these people, who have earned these benefits through their hard work.\n\nThe motion, as it stands, is dynamic and interesting. We must change the intensity rule, the number of weeks where benefits can be paid out, the weekly employment insurance benefits and the number of hours to qualify. These four factors deeply influence the financial status of our seasonal workers.\n\nBecause of these requirements, young people and women who could have seasonal jobs are leaving some areas because they cannot work the 910 hours required to qualify. This is also true for our seasonal workers.\n\nMost importantly, the law implies that these people have chosen not to work longer. That is what is left of the whole debate initiated by the Prime Minister when he called unemployed workers beer drinkers. Well, we have seen the consequences in the legislation. Today, a couple of weeks before Christmas, there are people who are wondering if they will have enough money to get through the holiday season and to survive until their next job in the spring.\n\nThe reason is not that there are fewer jobs than before, and the Liberals should understand that. Right now, we are in a period where the economy is strong but there are seasonal workers who have a job only during the summer. Because of restrictions in the EI program, either they qualify or they do not qualify, but the bottom line is that their annual income is lower than it was before the reform. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nThis proposal with regard to seasonal workers did not come only from opposition parties. It did not come only from the people we talked to on this subject. It was supported by the premiers, particularly those affected by the intensity rule that penalizes seasonal workers through a reduction of the number of weeks of benefits and the weekly amount.\n\nForestry workers who work hard but cannot work all year long find it difficult and unacceptable to see the government treat them as if they were lazy, especially when they do not have enough money to support their family. They then find that they do not have enough dignity to assume their responsibilities as family breadwinners and that is even harder on their self-esteem.\n\nFarm workers live the same situation. In my town of Saint-Denis de Kamouraska and in all other villages, some must try to qualify, but ultimately they still may not receive enough money to support their family. The situation is serious because farms are the backbone of rural areas. It will last until that infamous rule is abolished. The Government of Canada is saying to seasonal workers that they do not deserve the same status as other workers. Yet during all the years when the plan was a valid one, they were allowed to earn an income.\n\nWe were happy to have those workers being employed, often for low wages, so that in the industrial urbanized areas, particularly in Ontario, people could earn a good income in the processing industries. However, there were no processing industries in our own areas.\n\nIn the meantime, people end up working in agriculture and forestry. There are also those who work in turf pits. I know families around Rivière-du-Loup in which the husband works at the turf pit and the wife works as a secretary. However, her job is also seasonal because the company hires her for only part of the year. They have a combined income of about $30,000 a year. At the end of the day we end up with the intensity rule, under which for every 20 weeks of EI, benefits are cut back from 55% of earnings to 54%, then to 53% and so on. This means that over three years almost all seasonal workers see their benefit rate reduced to 50%.\n\nThe consequences of that are absolutely absurd. In my area, between 1992 and 1998 the federal government invested, from year to year approximately $85 million less in the regional economy. That means that even if industries are very aggressive and manage to get $2 million or $2.5 million out of the Canada jobs fund, there is still an $83 million shortfall in the end. Those who rely on these industries and are seasonal workers do not benefit from that.\n\nFaced with this situation, the federal government must respond quickly. Action is urgently required. The amendment the Liberal majority put forward earlier is not enough, in my opinion. It should be much more specific. I recall that at the first meeting of the Committee on Human Resources Development, the year following the 1997 election, there were members of the NDP, the Progressive Conservative Party and the Bloc Quebecois who asked that the first issue the committee were to consider be the EI reform.\n\nThe observations made today have already been made everywhere in our regions. The Liberal majority told us “This will not be on the agenda; we will not start on this right away.”\n\nI do not like the amendment introduced by the Liberals because it could lead to “committee-itis” and we will end up with the same song and dance from the department. The minister has been telling us for some time now “We are going to review the reform. We will assess the new plan after one year and then we will act accordingly.”\n\nA new minister is appointed and we get the same answer. We are now into the third year and soon enough it will be five years. Seasonal workers do not eat in the long term, they need to eat every day. They need rules providing them with enough money to feed their family when they are in between two jobs and retain their dignity.\n\nThis is what the federal government has failed to understand. I believe the amendment on the table is a sign the Liberal government has come to the realization that if it goes into an election with its employment insurance reform as it is, fewer liberal members will be elected in the maritimes and in Quebec, particularly in the areas concerned, and possibly in others too.\n\nThe liberal member said “There are three stakeholders in this: the government, the employers and the employees.” But the only thing the government has done so far is pocket the employment insurance fund surplus and pay down a part of the debt with it.\n\nHowever, those who contributed, the employers and the employees, believe that $6 out of $18 billion going every year to fund something else than what it was intended for is highway robbery. It is embezzlement. This is what it looks like to them. This is what is being put directly on the table.\n\nIn light of all these issues, it seems to me that the valuable motion introduced by the hon. member should be amended. Therefore, I move:\n\nThat the following words be added at the end of the motion: “and that the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development review the situation of these workers at its next sitting”.\n\nI am submitting this subamendment to the Chair to ensure that action will be taken in the short term. This amendment is supported by the hon. member for Portneuf and I hope that it will also get the support of the House. It would allow us to go beyond idle promises so that after two years all those who kept pushing to have this issue looked at by the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development would finally get some result as early as at the next sitting.\n\nIf the committee decides to sit tomorrow morning or the day after, it will not be a problem, we will be there. We will ensure that we can work on this issue.\n\nI am urging the House to support the amendment and the subamendment so that seasonal workers can finally get justice. This is also an opportunity for the Liberal government to eliminate the terrible burden that it put on workers.\n\nSeasonal workers are not lazy people. They want to work but the government has deprived them of the dignity associated with working. We must give it back to them.",

It is true that our seasonal workers have been stripped of their dignity. That happened some years ago already.\n\nIt happened the day that the Prime Minister of Canada, that same man who came to the riding I represent, then called Beauséjour, seeking votes. When he got back to Ottawa after campaigning in our riding, the first thing he told all the Canadians in the country is that he had been to New Brunswick where he had seen unemployed people bending their elbows in taverns. He said:\n\n“In New Brunswick, seasonal workers are in taverns collecting EI”.\n\nYou can easily imagine what Canadians think of seasonal workers now. These words came from the mouth of the man who went after these same people to get voted into this House and to now be the Prime Minister. This gives us some idea of what kind of man is leading this country today. The people of New Brunswick could readily find a number of terms to describe him.\n\nHowever, we have our hands full doing away with this perception and making Canadians realize that seasonal workers are not lazy people. If only hon. members could go to these plants, they would see that men and women there sometimes put in 100 or so hours a week for minimum wage, on their feet from morning to night, sunup to sundown, trying to earn a little money to take home.\n\nThe same thing can be seen in all sectors not just in New Brunswick. It is the same in any area of seasonal employment. First of all, it is not the workers who are seasonal, it is the work that is, or their communities, with their high unemployment levels.\n\nInstead of trying to develop our regions, instead of trying to create more jobs, this government has taken away the only program that helped these people. The reform was well thought out by this Liberal government. It focussed on one particular group, the workers in areas of seasonal employment. They are the ones targeted.\n\nThis has created a situation that is quite desperate in some areas. We have a discriminatory clause on the intensity rule. We have all talked about it but nobody is doing anything about it. I do not see the Liberal government doing anything about it.\n\nWe do not hear enough about the divisor. Most of the MPs in the House probably do not know what the word means because they have never been on EI. Well some of us have collected EI cheques because we have needed to. The divisor is a serious problem because some people receive only $30 week. Before the last cuts to the program, they were receiving maybe $200 or $250 a week. This is what the new EI has done to these people. We have to recognize that in order to fix it.\n\nHow about the pilot project we are under? Practically the whole country is under this project and not under the real act because of the small weeks. We are not talking about that either. That has to be permanently correctly.\n\nHow about the zones? We could solve maybe 80% of the problems in some areas if we had a minister who would rezone the way it should be done. Let us put the rural communities together and the urban communities together. In Albert county, Petitcodiac and Salisbury, we have two national parks in one zone and another one in another zone. One group of workers in these parks can qualify with 420 hours while the other group of workers need 669 hours.\n\nLet us talk about the duration for these two communities. In one community, the workers can receive 26 weeks of EI while in the other community the workers receive 15 weeks, but they are all in the same riding. How can this happen? It happened under this government.\n\nWe have to talk about the duration problem. We have people going with no incomes for up to 12 to 15 weeks. Can anybody here live with no income for 15 weeks? Why do we think that a person who has seasonal job can? It is unbelievable.\n\nLet us talk about the Canada jobs fund. The Canada jobs fund can be very good if it is used right. The government likes to talk about abuse in the EI system but it forgets to talk about its abuse of the fund. I have to say that I have seen it work very well in my riding if it is done right. All we have to do is get the politicians who make it not right out of the picture. Let us just do it right. Let us let the MP recommend the project.\n\nIn one instance I did not recommend a project in my riding because I knew there was something wrong with it. Let us think for a minute what happened to it. Within a year it had folded and we lost the money. I had not recommended that project but the minister went over my head and gave funds to that group knowing it was not going to work. There was no plan. Little political favours like that cost a lot money. Those programs will work if we want them to work.\n\nSince the last round of cuts, my riding alone has lot $52 million a year. New Brunswick has lost over a billion dollars in four years. That is a lot of money. That will not solve our problem. Our problem is high unemployment. We have to create the jobs. We probably will never create enough jobs for everybody to work year-round. We have to recognize that we have seasonal industries.",

U.S. border state politicians are increasing their rhetoric and are once again starting to rattle their trade sabres, threatening the livelihood of Canadian agricultural producers.\n\nThe most recent example of this protectionism is the anti-dumping and countervail petition to the U.S. department of commerce by the Montana producers' group, R-CALF. R-CALF claimed that Canadian cattle were government subsidized and were dumped on the U.S. market. Before the United States International Trade Commission finally ruled in Canada's favour, Canadian cattlemen were forced to pay a 5.63% provisional tariff on their export cattle, open their books to a foreign government agency and spend millions of dollars in legal fees to defend their industry against these groundless claims.\n\nCanadian cattlemen are fair traders but are being left exposed to the threat of multimillion dollar legal battles because of the indifference of the government and its failure to treat agricultural trade as a priority.\n\nThe government has had six years to reduce the bilateral trade irritants with our biggest trading partner. The current definition of dumping, which does not consider the cyclical nature of the agriculture industry, trapped Canadian cattlemen when they were forced to sell their cattle below the price of production several years ago. This poorly worded definition does more to hurt Canadian industry than to protect it. A responsible definition should reflect market cycles and take action in cases of predatory pricing and selling below home market prices.\n\nAnother aggravation for cattlemen in this case was the failure of the agriculture minister to take decisive action to implement changes recommended by the Canadian cattle industry, changes that would address trade tensions between Canada and the U.S.\n\nFrustrated by the inaction of the federal government in the wake of the R-CALF petition, a group of cattlemen in my riding came together and formed a producer group called the North West Beef Producers. This group raised over $200,000 to finance meetings with U.S. producers to seek a solution to these repeated trade disputes. It requested an expansion of the north west pilot project, specifically asking for a national exemption on Blue Tongue and recommending a treatment protocol for anaplasmosis, allowing year-round entry to Canada of feeder cattle from the U.S.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that considerable research has proven that lifting the restrictions will not adversely affect the health of the Canadian herd, and that these proposals do not depend on federal financial assistance for their success, the federal minister of agriculture left cattlemen high and dry, promising only to further explore the issue.\n\nAlthough the U.S. ITC ruled in Canada's favour, this government is making a mistake if it thinks that the Americans are willing to give up the fight. The government need only look at the $75,000 donation that the Government of South Dakota made to the R-CALF campaign to see how seriously the northern tier U.S. states view this issue.\n\nHow long will the minister of agriculture leave Canadian cattlemen exposed to the kind of trade harassment that we have seen over the last year before he implements the regulatory changes to the north west pilot project requested by industry groups and when will the changes to the definition of dumping that the industry is asking for be implemented?",

I would encourage him to come to the foreign affairs committee, which has discussed this issue in the past a number of times. His colleagues on the committee might remind him of the times that we discussed this issue at the foreign affairs committee. It is a very important issue for Canada.\n\nIn his intervention the member raised the anti-dumping investigation on live cattle which was recently concluded by the United States. It is important to say that the International Trade Commission ruled that Canada's shipments of live cattle are not injuring the U.S. industry. Therefore, dumping duties will not be assessed. The Government of Canada is very pleased with this decision.\n\nAs an export driven economy, Canada is concerned with the use of trade remedies such as anti-dumping by growing numbers of countries. These measures can significantly impair access to foreign markets. In this regard we recognize that there is scope for improvement in the rules which allow considerable discretion by investigating authorities. That is why we are seeking multilateral negotiations to clarify anti-dumping rules.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, at this time of the year it is very important that we take the opportunity, when it is given, to express our gratitude to the men and women of the Canadian forces who are serving abroad and will not be home with their families.\n\nIt was in this context that on December 1 I asked the Minister of National Defence a question pertaining to the replacement of the Canadian forces' Sea King maritime helicopter. I pointed out that the Liberal government's own 1994 defence white paper, which is the official government policy, promised that the Sea King would be replaced prior to the year 2000. The Liberal government's 1994 white paper states:\n\nCanada's maritime forces will be adequately equipped to carry out their new array of tasks. There is an urgent need for robust and capable new shipborne helicopters—. Work will, therefore, begin immediately to identify options and plans to put into service new affordable replacement helicopters by the end of the decade.\n\nThat is found at page 46 of the defence white paper.\n\nNote that the 1994 white paper promised to have new maritime helicopters put into service by the end of the decade, not tendered as a contract, but—and again I stress—put into service. That means that our maritime helicopter air crews should be taking delivery of the last few helicopters during the next couple of weeks.\n\nObviously, given the late date, the Liberal government has broken its promise to Canadians and its commitment to its very own defence white paper of 1994.\n\nIn November, during a meeting of the standing committee on national defence, the Minister of National Defence proclaimed that no new maritime helicopter would be in service until the year 2005 at the very earliest.\n\nThe Minister of National Defence has broken his own government's stated policy. This broken promise by the Liberal government has very serious consequences for the Canadian forces, and in particular the personnel. Continuing to use the Sea Kings has reduced the operational capabilities of our forces, and it has also placed those air crews at risk.\n\nThe Sea Kings are now 35 years old, older than most of the people serving as crew on those crafts. The equipment is technically out of date and requires over 30 hours of maintenance for every one hour of flight. Often, when needed on missions or during military manoeuvres, the Sea Kings are unavailable due to technical difficulties.\n\nIn my question on December 1 I said that Canadians continually read about how forces operations have been hampered by the failures of the Sea Kings. It took only one day to find an example. On December 2 the news headlines read that a Sea King helicopter experienced engine failure and was forced to make an emergency landing on the water at Dili Harbour in East Timor. This was an operational disaster that put Canadian air service personnel at risk.\n\nToday the Canadian Press carried a story that the Sea Kings are literally disintegrating in the skies, with at least seven significant pieces falling off in mid-flight since July. For example, on July 7 a window popped off a cargo door, landing near a house in York Harbour, Newfoundland. Worse still, on October 12 a bolt popped off a Sea King, forcing an emergency landing at Shearwater.\n\nThis is unacceptable. The Liberal policy has been broken. I believe that the government has lost its commitment to the Canadian forces. It has lost capability for the forces and, most tragically, lost lives.\n\nI ask the government, where is the replacement for the Sea King helicopter?",

But, as the minister has said, it is time to replace the Sea Kings.\n\nThe minister has confirmed on several occasions in the House that, as far as equipment goes, the new maritime helicopter project is his first priority. We are working on an acquisition strategy.\n\nBut this work is taking more time than we had foreseen in the white book, because the government wants to make sure we will have the equipment that meets our needs best.\n\nThe government must make sure that the new maritime helicopter will met the operational needs of the Canadian forces. For a procurement program as important as this one, several departments have to be consulted. The government will make an announcement when everything is ready.\n\nWhat my colleague emphatically calls broken promises is the dedication of my government to make things right from all points of view.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the attention of the House yet again an issue that has been before the Canadian public for some time. I am talking about the failure of the solicitor general's department to take control of some of its own internal agencies.\n\nWith respect to this issue, the CSIS agent had sensitive documents taken from a car while at a hockey game in Toronto. We know that the head of CSIS has commenced an investigation, but since that time more security breaches have been exposed.\n\nThe solicitor general by his acquiescence has been putting in question the good name of the CSIS agents and the RCMP. The problem is obvious. There is no accountability from the top officers at CSIS or the solicitor general and those within his department.\n\nThe recent sad chapter involves a CSIS agent at a hockey game with top secret documents pertaining to the plan of the country with respect to internal security. The solicitor general should have said the puck stops here. Obviously that has not happened.\n\nTime and time again we have seen the non-answers, the rhetoric and the tired preprogrammed responses of the solicitor general in the House. He states that he takes national security as a serious matter, that it is a top priority for the government, and that there is a process which has to be followed. Bunk. This is absolute nonsense. If this were the case things would change. They do not change and that is very obvious.\n\nThe solicitor general did not inform the head of SIRC, Paule Gauthier. She found out through reading the Globe and Mail almost a week after the event occurred. The solicitor general said he was informed of the event by the director, Ward Elcock. We know Mr. Elcock does not have a great deal of respect for this place or certainly for parliamentarians. He has no respect for SIRC and no respect even for the minister, I would suggest.\n\nThe director, aided by the minister, has undermined the role of SIRC. It appears at worst that he deliberately covered up the theft of the CSIS plan or at best acquiesced and sat on it. The solicitor general seems oblivious to this. The lights are on but there does not appear to be anybody home. Furthermore, no one has held the head of CSIS, Mr. Elcock, accountable. The CSIS board has had vacancies for years. It was only this summer that the inspector general's role was filled, just prior to this fiasco being uncovered.\n\nThe solicitor general said that he did not inform the Prime Minister's Office. Yet the Prime Minister was overseas making comments about it and trying to downplay it as a serious incident and a serious breach of security. If the solicitor general did not inform the Prime Minister, how was the Prime Minister able to make such pointed comments? Who informed him and what faith should we have in a solicitor general who keeps this from the Prime Minister?\n\nThe solicitor general took great licence with the word immediately when the theft had occurred three weeks before and had already been reported in the Globe and Mail before it was uncovered at all. Why was SIRC not informed immediately?\n\nIf the solicitor general is covering up for CSIS, this needs to be exposed. Was he trying to hide the embarrassment of the incident from the Prime Minister and the Canadian people? If everyone is informed and the process is going to work, everyone has to be informed.\n\nThe solicitor general obviously does not understand his departments. He does not understand the individuals who are involved and he cannot continue to pass the buck. These are very serious communication breakdowns. We already know that the RCMP and CSIS are not communicating effectively. Obviously the solicitor general is not prepared to step in and see that his departments are co-operating.\n\nThe parliamentary secretary will tell us in a few minutes that things are fine. It will be the same broken record response that we will hear from the solicitor general. He will parrot the same line, but we know this is a problem in the country right now. The solicitor general should have at least asked to call the director before him and make him take account for what occurred.\n\nCanadians are very worried, as they should be, about national security. The solicitor general and the government, by their actions, demonstrate that they do not take these matters seriously. They demonstrate that they have no respect for the concerns of parliamentarians and Canadians at large.",

There was a security breach, which I deplore as much as my colleague, but he is not the only one who is concerned with the safety of Canadians.\n\nWhen a security breach occurs, and it does happen unfortunately because our systems rely on humans who sometimes make mistakes, there is a process in place to deal with that.\n\nMy colleague knows full well that this very House established two institutions at the same time as the Canadian Security Intelligence Service: the Inspector General and the Security Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC. Both are investigating these matters.\n\nBoth institutions are totally independent and have unrestricted access to all CSIS documents.\n\nThese matters to which my colleague referred are being reviewed by these two institutions. There was absolutely no obligation on the part of the minister to inform SIRC. It is not his duty. SIRC is a review committee.\n\nI somewhat deplore the fact that, as soon as an incident occurs, my colleague opposite always has the same reaction: first he panics, then he questions the value of institutions that were established by this parliament to deal with these matters.\n\nAgain, I am sorry to say that if I am asked the same question tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, in three weeks or in a month, I will give the same answer.",
