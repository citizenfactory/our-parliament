            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to share my time with my colleague, the member for Mississauga South.\n\nThe first thing I would like to say is the fact that we are having this debate really underlines the fact that prorogation was not necessary.\n\nWhile of course the economy is important, this issue that we are debating now in a kind of take note debate is not something that leads anywhere. It was originally started as a fill-in between the throne speech and the budget. Now because the government apparently has nothing better to do, no legislation, no real agenda, we are continuing on this merry path.\n\nIt looks as if the government has no legislation, no ideas, and just a well rested government after three months of holiday. Otherwise we would have legislation; we would have something meaty. All this recalibration and what does it lead to? A debate that right now leads nowhere.\n\nI do not understand why the government had to prorogue. I do not understand why this recalibration led to nothing whatsoever in terms of any new agenda.\n\nNevertheless, as finance critic I would not deny that the economy is important. Indeed, it is probably job one. Therefore, I am happy to discuss it even though, as I said, a government which really had recalibrated, a government that really had anything in the way of new ideas would have some legislation and something more substantial before the House at this time.\n\nI thought I would begin, because it is timely, with the release yesterday of the report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the amazing reaction of the Minister of Finance in the House in question period yesterday.\n\nI have the report of the Parliamentary Budget Officer. On the very first page he says that his budget projections are based on the same private sector economic forecasts that the budget was based on. He takes those forecasts as a given and from there devises the budget projections.\n\nWhat did the finance minister say in the House yesterday? He said that this Parliamentary Budget Officer did not believe these 50 eminent economists who made their private sector forecasts, which was absolutely totally wrong because as the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself said on page 1, his forecasts of the budget were based on precisely the same private sector GDP forecasts, as the finance minister used. He attacked virulently the Parliamentary Budget Officer, but on precisely the wrong erroneous grounds.\n\nLet me talk about the substance of this report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, not the fictitious allegation that he did not accept the private sector forecasts. He did.\n\nThis is a two-step process. In step one we take the economic forecasts, and the finance minister and the Parliamentary Budget Officer are on precisely the same page in that respect. In step two we translate those economic forecasts into the budget forecasts. There are many steps between the economic forecasts and the budget forecasts.\n\nOne of the complaints of the Parliamentary Budget Officer is that there is a lack of transparency on the part of the finance minister because he does not tell us what is inside that black box, what assumptions he makes in translating the economic forecasts into the budget forecasts. There is all sorts of room for little tricks and we do not know what he is up to.\n\nThat is one of the problems the Parliamentary Budget Officer had and that is why he asked for greater transparency on the part of the government and the Department of Finance, so that people would know how they get from the economic forecasts to the budget forecasts.\n\nIn general terms, the Parliamentary Budget Officer made three points, all of which indicate that the government looks at these matters with rose coloured spectacles.\n\nPoint number one, how many times have we heard the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance say that Canada is leading the way, Canada did much less badly than any other country? That happens not to be true. The Parliamentary Budget Officer took data from the IMF, he looked at the severity of the recession in all G7 countries, and he found that Canada was in the middle of the pack.\n\nCanada is not leading the way. We all want Canada to lead the way, but we on this side, as well as the Parliamentary Budget Officer, also want to be telling the truth. The truth is that we are not leading the way. We are in the middle of the pack and so it is time the government stopped boasting and telling things that are not true with regard to Canada's position compared to other G7 countries.\n\nThe second point the Parliamentary Budget Officer made was that it was not true that the risk was way down. He used various methods to show that the risk to the forecasts going forward remained high. The risk has not diminished immensely since some months ago. So contrary to what the government says, there is still a huge amount of risk out there and a huge amount of uncertainty with regard to the forecast for the budget.\n\nThe third way in which the government is excessively rosy according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer is that the Conservatives are being too rosy in making their deficit forecasts. Even though he accepts the same private sector forecasts as the government, the deficit after year four is not $2 billion as the government says, but is more likely to be $12 billion according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Also Don Drummond, chief economist at TD Bank, on television yesterday concurred. He said he was much closer to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's number than he was to the government's number.\n\nIn other words, according to the government's own planning, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, according to Don Drummond, the government is lowballing the deficit estimates and it is much closer to $12 billion than it is to $2 billion.\n\nIn summary, the government is exaggerating Canada's relative position in terms of doing well. The government is exaggerating the reduction and uncertainty over past months, and is lowballing the deficit according to what a prudent, rational forecaster or economist would conclude.\n\nOne should acknowledge that the Parliamentary Budget Officer has enormously more credibility on anything to do with economic forecasts than does our finance minister. We just have to go back to November 2008 when with that highly discredited economic statement by the government, we may recall that the finance minister was predicting nothing but surpluses; surpluses forever and then he went to a $25 billion, $32 billion, $56 billion deficit.\n\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer, and I must say virtually every other economist in the land, knew full well in November of 2008, when the recession had already begun, that we were heading into deficits. So the forecasting record of the Parliamentary Budget Officer is far superior to that of the Minister of Finance and therefore he should take note. He should listen to what the Parliamentary Budget Officer says rather than lashing out at him on the basis of arguments that are simply erroneous.\n\nI would conclude by saying that the Parliamentary Budget Officer is a great asset to our country in order to ensure the government is honest in its economic prognostications. Rather than lashing out at this person, similar to the way the government lashed out at Linda Keen, the head of the Nuclear Safety Commission, the way the government lashed out at Richard Colvin, the civil servant, the way the government lashes out at any public servant, any officer of Parliament who dares to disagree with it in any regard, instead of that the government should take note of the wisdom of the Parliamentary Budget Officer.",

But my point is that if the government had really done anything substantive in its so-called recalibration, we would not just be standing here on a Friday debating, we would be debating actual actions taken by the government, legislation.\n\nWith a three month holiday, we would think that the government would have had time to produce a plan and action that it could put before Parliament and debate rather than listening to these silly questions which will not do any good whatsoever to the economy. It would have been much better if the government really had, during this period of prorogation, developed a plan such that there were concrete measures before the House today.",

It has to do at least that because the working age population is growing by over 1% a year. So in fact, the budget's own unemployment projections show the jobless rates are actually going to increase this year from 8.2% to 8.5%. The government's solution is further tax cuts. The government thinks that somehow is going to grow the economy and create jobs.\n\nI would like to ask the hon. member this. How effective does he think the tax cuts are going to be?",

Apparently not because only one bill, other than the budget document, is on the table, and the budget was coming anyway. It was no surprise that this had to happen. It goes to the question of whether we can believe what the government says. Canadians were very upset about the prorogation and I do not think the government really gets it.\n\nAccountability is a very important aspect and trait of people with honesty and integrity. Without honesty and integrity there can be no accountability. In my profession as a chartered accountant, one is accountable when one can explain or justify one's actions or decisions in a manner which is truthful and plain, as well as clear, concise and correct. If one adopts that definition of accountability, one will find that the government does not meet the test and has not met the test in so many ways.\n\nI will give an example. On page 5 of the throne speech, which can also be found in his budget speech to Parliament, the finance minister stated:\n\nBalancing the nation’s books will not come at the expense of pensioners...or by raising taxes on hard-working Canadians.\n\nThat is kind of interesting.

            "text": "The member is quite right, it kills jobs.\n\nWe know what the government said. It said that it would not raise taxes or penalize pensioners, but what did it do? Starting April 1, a couple of weeks from now, employment insurance premiums for employers and employees will increase by almost 9%.\n\nI remember being in this place when a direct question was asked about the raising of taxes and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance said that EI premiums were not taxes. The government does not think they are taxes. I think Canadians know that a payroll tax is a tax. They know it is money coming out of their pockets.\n\nThere will be an immediate 9% increase, 15¢ on the current $1.73 per $100 of earnings, and it will continue. In fact, cumulatively over the five years of this budget, it is projected to be about $19 billion. Can anyone imagine? That is quite a large number to suggest that it is doing wonderful things without raising taxes but it represents more than a third of the deficit that it is trying to erase.\n\nWhat else did the government do? On January 1, 2011, it will be imposing a 31.5% punitive tax on income distributions to income trust holders. That decision was made after it had promised in the 2006 election not to tax income trusts. People believed and trusted the government and yet on the following October 31 the finance minister said that this 31.5% tax would be imposed, that it would be delayed somewhat but that it would happen. That is a 31.5% punitive tax on hard-working Canadians, mostly pensioners.\n\nDo members know what that did to the value of their investments? In one short week it wiped out $35 billion of the hard-earned retirement nest egg of Canadians. What did the government say? It said that it would bring in pension income splitting and that would take care of it.\n\nIt sort of sounded like that might work, except that I did a little a homework and found out that only about 25% of seniors have defined benefit pension plans. Only those kinds of pension plans qualify for pension income splitting. However, of those 25%, if we take out those who do not have a partner to split with and take out those who already are at the lowest marginal tax rate, the percentage of seniors who actually can benefit from pension income splitting is 14.2%. Only 14.2% of seniors will be able benefit even one iota from pension income splitting.\n\nWhy was the government not honest with Canadians? Why did it not tell them the truth, that it was going to tax 2.5 million seniors, pensioners, people who have their retirement nest egg all set up and cannot take any more risk, people who do not have pensions, people for whom the income trust was a instrument to allow people to make an investment that would provide them with a monthly cash flow that would emulate a pension?\n\nThose people have been destroyed. Fifteen percent of the income trusts have now been bought by foreign interests. It has cost us $1.5 billion in annual tax revenue because of that. Before the end of this calendar year, many more, if not all of the other income trusts, will be dissolved. That instrument disappears. This is pretty serious stuff. This has to do with integrity and accountability.\n\nWhat else will the government do? It will raise the air travellers transport tax. Two days ago, the transport minister said that cutting taxes creates jobs, provides more hope and more opportunity but we are raising the taxes on travelling for Canadians.\n\nThis goes to a question of character and a question of accountability. The government says that it has a $54 billion deficit that it needs to deal with. The Parliamentary Budget Officer says that the government is being too rosy on its growth rates and on the performance of the labour markets. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's analysis, the government will still be short over $10 billion to balance the budget, and yet it is focused primarily on a fiscal deficit. What the government does not mention is that concurrently we have a social deficit.\n\nOne of the immediate reactions to the budget came from Alex Himelfarb, the former head of the Privy Council who ran the civil service. He was here a long time. Just to paraphrase his statements, he said that no one can be very clear about what is going to happen over the next five years with regard to eliminating the deficit and that nobody knows whether the budget will succeed over the next three, four or five years. However, what we do know, he says, is that Canada faces huge challenges, for example, the impact of an aging population, social and economic programs, health programs and the tax system. He says that those things will make the numbers really problematic. He is concerned that it will be very problematic for the government to achieve fiscal balance again, which the Conservatives squander every time they get in government. They squander surpluses that are passed on to them.\n\nMr. Himelfarb went on to say that smaller government and lower taxes were not the answers to meeting the challenges. He said that if we are going to meet our challenges on the environment, climate change and deepening inequities, we will need to do other things.\n\nWill the government meet the challenges on creating a competitive economy? Apparently not. To meet those challenges, Mr. Himelfarb concludes that smaller government and lower taxes will not do it.\n\nWe could debate this all we want but the critical issue is that the government said that it would not raise taxes. It has clearly misled Canadians and Parliament because it is in fact raising income taxes on the backs of pensioners and hard-working Canadians.",

He has been here as long as I have and he remembers very well what happened when the the former Liberal government under Prime Minister Chrétien decided to balance its budget. The first thing it did was slash $25 billion from transfers to the provinces in support of health care and social programs. The Liberals balanced their budget on the backs of the poor and the infirm, and they will never get rid of that shame. I am embarrassed that the member would stand up and act so sanctimonious after the devastating thing that his former prime minister and government did to the poor and infirm in this country. He should be ashamed of himself.\n\nOut of the masses of people who said that this budget was a budget for our time and that it would help lead us out of the recession, it is amazing how the Liberals picked one person who opposed it, as opposed to 25 who gave us rave reviews. I am surprised those members did not use the CBC as one of their supporters.\n\nIs the member prepared to go to the 14% of seniors who are income splitting and tell them that they do not deserve it? Is that what he is saying?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, in budget 2009, we presented Canada's economic action plan to stabilize and protect our economy for the short term, while taking steps to improve Canada's long-term economic growth and prosperity. The plan was designed to boost confidence and economic growth and to support Canadians and their families during a period of severe global economic weakness. Budget 2010 builds on these goals. The measures presented in budget 2010 will contribute to Canada's recovery and sustain our economic advantage now and for the future.\n\nCanada has weathered the global recession better than all major industrialized countries and we are returning to economic growth following the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. However, we do not yet have a firmly established recovery. As such, Canada's economic action plan will continue to provide unprecedented support for the Canadian economy through 2010 by going beyond the immediate crisis and building on strategic advantages set out in advantage Canada in order to create a more competitive economy.\n\nYear two of the action plan delivers $19 billion in federal stimulus spending, augmented by $6 billion in stimulus from provinces, territories, municipalities and other partners, for a total of $25 billion. Over 90% of year two funding is committed and ready to be delivered. This includes $3.2 billion in personal income tax relief, more than $4 billion in actions to create and protect jobs, $7.7 billion to modernize infrastructure and improve housing across Canada, $1.9 billion to create the economy of tomorrow and $2.2 billion to support industries and communities.\n\nThe action plan gives Canadians more flexibility to improve their quality of life even when times are tough. Our plan leaves more money in their pockets. It makes permanent tax reductions that build a strong foundation for future economic growth and higher living standards for Canadians.\n\nReducing the tax burden on Canadians has been a key element of getting through the global recession while setting the foundation for future growth. Tax relief and the economic action plan benefit all taxpayers, especially lower and middle income Canadians. For example, Canada's low and middle income seniors are benefiting from an increase in the age credit amount. As a result of this increase, the amount of tax relief provided by the age credit for this year alone is up to $967. As well, the working income tax benefit has been enhanced so that it now provides tax relief of $1.1 billion annually to reduce thereby the welfare wall and strengthen work incentives for low income working Canadians.\n\nIndeed, even before the introduction of Canada's economic action plan, Canadians were benefiting from the tax relief introduced by this government. A key example is the two percentage point reduction in the goods and services tax rate. This is a tax break for all Canadians, even those who do not earn enough to pay personal income tax.\n\nCanadians deserve praise for their ability to persevere during this global recession. The economic situation has taken a toll on workers and their families, and Canadians need to have faith that their government is there to assist them. Through Canada's economic action plan, the government is giving Canadians the security and support they require.\n\nThe budget is helping workers and their families by strengthening benefits and enhancing the availability of training while the economy moves into recovery. Under the action plan, $1.6 billion will be available to strengthen benefits for Canadian workers in 2010-11, including up to five extra weeks of EI regular benefits, to a maximum of 50 weeks, for all eligible claimants.\n\nThe economic action plan is also providing an additional $1 billion in 2010-11 to enhance training opportunities for Canadian workers. These measures will not only assist workers in need now, but will also give them the opportunity to have more meaningful jobs in the future. Canada's economic action plan includes provincial and territorial actions, and is expected to create or maintain approximately 220,000 jobs by the end of 2010.\n\nTraditional industries, including the forest sector and manufacturing industries, have been hit hard by declining sales in the slowing economy. The communities where these industries are located need assistance as they adjust to cyclical and structural changes in the economy.\n\nTo promote clean energy generation in the forest industry, budget 2010 creates the next generation renewable power initiative, with $100 million over the next four years to support the introduction of advanced clean energy technologies in the forest sector.\n\nBudget 2010 also provides $135 million in funding over two years for the National Research Council's technology cluster initiatives. The clusters accelerate regional innovation by fostering research collaboration among governments, businesses and academic institutions and by promoting the development of knowledge-intensive companies in key areas.\n\nDuring this time of continuing global economic uncertainty, Canadians can be assured that our government will never stand by and allow communities in Canada to suffer from threats beyond their borders. Canada's economic action plan accelerated and expanded federal investments in infrastructure. The immediate actions we took have helped Canada come out of the economic crisis with more modern and greener infrastructure. Moreover, for the 2009-10 construction seasons, the government has committed close to $5.5 billion in stimulus funding to over 7,000 projects. Of that amount, almost $4 billion is expected to be spent in 2010.\n\nInvestments have moved quickly. We have shortened the time needed to provide federal approval for major projects. We have partnered with the provinces, territories and municipalities, not only to identify ready to go projects but also to leverage their funding contributions. For example, the economic action plan included $500 million over two years for the recreational infrastructure Canada initiative. The initiative is being delivered by the regional development agencies in their respective areas to promote the construction of new community recreational facilities and to upgrade existing facilities across Canada. Investments in infrastructure are paving roads, fixing sewers, repairing bridges and creating jobs.\n\nProvinces and territories should also be assured that they will be able to continue to count on long-term, growing support from this government. In 2010-2011, major federal transfers to provinces and territories will total an all time high of nearly $53.6 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2009-10. In 2010-11, the support includes an addition $1.4 billion in the Canada health transfer, $321 million in the Canada social transfer, $187 million in equalization and $166 million in territorial formula financing. In addition, $525 million will be provided through one time payments to ensure that provinces are protected from any decline in their total transfers in 2010-11, in recognition of the short-term challenges being faced by provinces as we emerge from the global recession.\n\nWe are ensuring that all provinces receive at least as much support through major transfers this year as they did last year. The government's role in building a more competitive economy includes creating an environment that enables its visionaries to excel and that does not stand in the way of their success. Any competitive economy requires competitive taxes, and tax relief supports businesses and jobs in the short term by providing up-front stimulus, which helps businesses weather challenging economic times while creating a long-term advantage for sustained economic and employment growth.\n\nSince 2006 the government has implemented bold tax reductions and tax changes to provide businesses with a competitive business environment that encourages new investment, growth and job creation in Canada. Canada's economic action plan introduced temporary measures to make computers, as well as machinery and equipment for manufacturing and processing, more affordable for Canadian businesses. Our economic action plan also included a permanent increase in the amount of small business income eligible for the reduced federal income tax rate.\n\nThis year, as a result of federal and provincial business tax changes since 2006, Canada will have the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G7 and below the average of the OECD. By 2012, Canada will also have the lowest statutory corporate income tax rate in the G7.\n\nThe tax relief actions our government has taken are positioning Canadian businesses to emerge stronger and better equipped to compete globally as the economy recovers. These measures to reduce the tax burden on Canadian businesses are complemented by the elimination of remaining tariffs on machinery and equipment and inputs. This will lower operating costs for Canadian manufacturers and encourage innovation. This means that Canadian manufacturers will be able to import goods for further production in Canada without the burden of tariffs and the cost of complying with certain customs rules such as rules of origin.\n\nTogether, these will give Canadian manufacturers a competitive advantage in the global marketplace by lowering production costs, increasing competitiveness and enhancing innovation and productivity. Manufacturers have stated during consultations that such a measure will help them maintain and increase production and employment in Canada and expand their exports. Budget 2010 delivers.\n\nA competitive advantage also requires support for the pursuit of knowledge. Our government recognizes that research and development is an important driver of long-term economic growth and that discoveries stemming from research help improve the quality of life of Canadians. Canada ranks first among the G7 countries in terms of expenditures on research and development in the higher education sector as a share of the economy.\n\nBuilding on this leadership position, the economic action plan includes an unprecedented $4 billion in additional funding for research infrastructure, knowledge and commercialization. Budget 2010 continues this momentum by providing additional funding to support world class research and researchers, including $32 million per year to the federal research granting councils to sustain their overall support for researchers at Canadian universities, colleges and hospitals and to strengthen commercialization.\n\nBudget 2010 also doubles the budget of the college and community innovation program, providing an additional $15 million per year to promote research collaboration between colleges and companies in all parts of Canada. In addition, the budget announced a new small and medium size enterprise innovation commercialization program, with $40 million over two years for federal departments and agencies to demonstrate the use of innovative prototype products and technologies developed by small and medium size businesses.\n\nThe government's plan is to ensure that our country will emerge from the recession with a stronger economic advantage than ever before. There is no question that our country has come through the global economic storm in an enviable position. As Canadians we should be proud of what we have accomplished during a time when other nations were struggling with far greater economic challenges.\n\nThat Canada endured recent global turbulence with such resilience is a testament to our economic action plan. It was one of the most comprehensive stimulus packages in the industrialized world, an approach endorsed by the G20 and the G7. As I indicated earlier, the impact of the recession on Canada's economy has been less severe than it has been on virtually all other major industrialized economies, and Canada is expected to have the strongest recovery in the G7 in 2010.\n\nThe world can learn a lot from Canada. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winner in economics, recently said:\n\nthe quiet success stories deserve at least as much attention as the spectacular failures. We need to learn from those countries that evidently did it right. And leading that list is our neighbor to the north. Right now, Canada is a very important role model.\n\nAs host of this summer's G20 summit, Canada can serve as an example of how to prepare for and prevent a crisis, and an example of the global contributions that must be made to overcome it. While we are seeing some signs of recovery from the serious global recession, the situation remains fragile. Thanks to our strong economic and fiscal foundation, as well as the timely implementation of our economic action plan, Canada is in relatively good shape compared with other advanced economies.\n\nBased on this position of strength, I can assure members that our country will be a vital part of the long-term solutions, as well as a meeting place for a number of key international events this year that will help transform a world in crisis into one of unparalleled long-term stability.",

I come from a riding that has seen a phenomenal number of jobs lost in the riding, especially in regard to our resource industry.\n\nI want to ask the hon. member about corporate tax cuts. The fact is that the former Liberal government believed that corporate tax cuts were the answer and the Conservative government has followed in its footsteps. The Liberal government started reducing the rate from 28% to 21%, and then under the Conservative government it went from 21% to 18%, and now it is going to 15%. Across the board, provincially and federally, we have seen a 36% reduction in corporate tax cuts, and yet business productivity has not increased.\n\nWhy is it that the Conservative government continues to go down the road of corporate tax cuts and increases the taxes on workers? The Conservatives are going to tell us that they are not increasing taxes on workers and families, but they are. The HST is coming in, and there will be tax increases on workers with regard to the EI increases starting in 2011, some $19 billion.\n\nInstead of all of these big corporate tax cuts, does the hon. member not think that the government should be investing in people in general?",

There will be a 9% increase in employment insurance premiums in the first year. There is the imposition of a 31.5% punitive tax on income trust distribution, which incidentally wiped out $35 billion of the retirement nest eggs of Canadians. The Conservatives are also imposing a new air traveller's tax, notwithstanding that the Minister of Transport said just two days ago that cutting taxes creates jobs, more hope and more opportunity. It seems to be a contradiction. It goes to character. That is the issue.\n\nHow could the member stand in his place and say the Conservatives are not raising taxes when in fact they are?

That comment is attributed to Kevin Lynch, former clerk of the Privy Council. In 2007, Canadian business spending on R and D, about 1% of GDP, ranked 14th in the OECD, well below the average 1.6% and only one-third of that of Sweden, Finland and Korea. In addition, productivity growth was actually worse in the last decade.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence out there that the government's agenda of reducing corporate taxes is not having the desired effect.

I am confused because the government's actions seem to indicate otherwise.\n\nIt seems the number one priority of the Conservatives is to help out their CEO friends and big banks, but not Canadians who are struggling to survive these uncertain economic times.\n\nThe Prime Minister plans to cut corporate income taxes from 22.12% in 2006 to 15% by 2012, leaving Canada with the lowest corporate tax rates in the G8. By doing so, the Conservatives have also deprived the treasury of billions of dollars that could have been invested in Canadians, for example to lift seniors and children out of poverty.\n\nLast year with the corporate rate at 19% and most Canadians trying to cope with the serious recession, Canada's big five banks had profits totalling $15.9 billion. In 2009 the Conservative tax cuts to that point, 3.12%, fattened those profits by $496 million. No wonder the banks had enough money to pay enormous bonuses to their senior executives.\n\nThe government's justification for cutting the income taxes of profitable businesses is that the cuts improve competitiveness, lead to investment, innovation and jobs. The evidence is almost entirely to the contrary.\n\nAcross the board corporate income tax cuts are a completely ineffective way to grow the economy. They are a blunt weapon of a government without vision. They result in growing inequality, declining public services and an economy that serves the market, not people.\n\nThe Conservatives believe that helping out these corporate CEOs will help create jobs. There is no proof.\n\nIf we go back a little bit, in 2000, then Liberal finance minister Paul Martin cut corporate income tax rates by one quarter, from 28% to 21%, to be phased in over five years. The Conservative government has continued with those cuts from 21% in 2007 to 18% today, and the budget confirmed that the government is ignoring the NDP's advice and will further reduce the rate to 15% by 2012.\n\nThose cuts have taken hundreds of billions of dollars out of the revenues that pay for health care, education, infrastructure and fighting climate change.",

When young Joannie rose above her misfortune and changed a negative into a triumph, it becomes the triumph of a nation's spirit over adversity.\n\nMy constituent asks the House to balance the challenges of difficult funding decisions and the taxpayers' agenda with the spirit of national pride created by Canadian Olympians. Therefore, during the next two years, our Conservative government is delivering to Canadian Olympians an additional $34 million on top of $11 million a year we already spend.

The new rules must be posted at the airport, and airlines must inform passengers of their rights and the process to file for compensation. The bill is not meant to punish the airlines. If the airlines follow the rules, they will not have to pay any compensation at all.\n\nThe petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to support Bill C-310, which would introduce Canada's first air passengers' bill of rights.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I believe I left off where I was talking about the Conservatives and their corporate tax cuts. I was relating it to the CEOs.\n\nLet us look at what the Prime Minister has done for his CEO friends. The Prime Minister plans to cut corporate income taxes from 22.12% in 2006 to 15% by 2012 leaving Canada with the lowest corporate tax rates in the G8. By doing so the Prime Minister also deprived the treasury of billions of dollars that could have been invested in Canadians, like lifting seniors and children out of poverty.\n\nLast year, with the corporate rate at 19% and most Canadians trying to cope with the serious recession, Canada's big five banks had profits totalling $15.9 billion. In 2009 the government's tax cuts to that point, 3.12%, fattened those profits by $496.1 million. No wonder the banks had enough money to pay enormous bonuses to their senior executives.\n\nThe government's justification for cutting the income taxes on profitable businesses is that the cuts improve competitiveness and lead to investment, innovation and jobs. The evidence is almost entirely to the contrary.\n\nAcross the board corporate income tax cuts are a completely ineffective way to grow an economy. They are a blunt weapon of a government without vision. They result in growing inequality, declining public services, and an economy that serves the market, not people.\n\nThe Conservatives believe that helping out these corporate CEOs will help create jobs:\n\nLower corporate income taxes result in more business investment by both domestic and foreign firms operating in Canada, which leads to new and better jobs and increased living standards for Canadians.\n\nThat was from the Department of Finance in 2008.\n\nReally? Let us look at the historical context. In 2000 then Liberal finance minister Paul Martin cut corporate income tax rates by one quarter, from 28% to 21%, to be phased in over five years.\n\nThe Conservative government has continued those cuts from 21% in 2007 to 18% today. The budget confirmed that the government is ignoring NDP advice and will further reduce the rate to 15% by 2012.\n\nThose cuts have taken hundreds of billions of dollars out of the revenues that pay for things like health care, education, infrastructure and fighting climate change. Why did the government do it? It says that such cuts create jobs through investment and innovation in our future economy. But do they really?\n\nIt also argues that we need these cuts to be competitive. That is another canard. The evidence suggests these assertions are misleading and wrong-headed. Who says this? It is stated by Statistics Canada, Finance Canada, leading economists and former Privy Council clerks.\n\nLet us talk about some facts. Corporate tax breaks have not stimulated investment. Despite a 36% drop in corporate taxes both federal and provincial in the last decade, and record profits for much of that time, business spending on machinery and equipment has declined as a share of GDP. Total business investment spending has declined as a percentage of corporate cashflow and this is sourced from StatsCanada and Finance Canada.\n\nCorporate tax breaks have not stimulated innovation. “The intensity of IT use by Canadian businesses is only half that of the U.S” said Kevin Lynch, the former clerk of the Privy Council and cabinet secretary.\n\nIn 2007 Canadian business spending on R and D, about 1% of GDP, ranked 14th in the OECD, well below the average of 1.6% and only one-third of that of Sweden, Finland and Korea.\n\nCorporate tax breaks have not increased productivity. Kevin Lynch said that despite Canadian corporate tax rates well below those of the United States, “business-sector productivity growth was actually worse in the decade just ended”. Low productivity growth, of course, is a sign that business has not invested in new labour saving technologies or in productivity enhancing R and D.\n\nCanada's business sector productivity in 2007 was 75% of that of the U.S., down from 90% in the early 1980s. This, despite cuts in federal corporate income tax rates from nearly 40% to the current 18%.\n\nAre we more competitive? In 1999, the year before Paul Martin's tax cuts, Canada was fifth in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness list. Today we are in ninth place, well behind most Nordic countries, which collect as much as 50% of their GDP in taxes each year. Clearly, the link between tax cuts and performance is a myth.\n\nFar from tax cuts influencing business investment decisions, if anything, corporate investment performance has become weaker, even as corporate taxes have been deeply cut. In 2007, before the Conservative corporate income tax cuts began, Canada's combined federal and provincial corporate income tax rate was already below the combined state and federal rate of our chief competitor, the United States, and below the rates of all but one other G7 member, the U.K.\n\nWhen the Conservative cuts are fully implemented, Canada will have the lowest rate in the G7 by far, 12 percentage points below the comparable U.S. rate. While corporate profits in Canada are on the rise, investment, innovation, and productivity continue to lag.\n\nIt is a myth that corporate tax cuts create jobs in Canada, a dangerous myth that leads to reduced support for essential programs, services, and infrastructure on which Canadians rely. It also leads to a bigger deficit, higher debt payments, and increased taxes for the rest of us.\n\nThe Conservatives are also keen to help out their friends on Bay Street who are struggling, helping those downtrodden bank executives receive even fatter pay increases. While the finance minister has told Canadians to tighten their belts, the CEOs of Canada's big five banks saw pay increases of 10% in 2009.\n\nFor example, the CEO of the Bank of Nova Scotia was awarded the biggest increase, 29%, followed by the Bank of Montreal CEO at 25%. The CEO from the Bank of Nova Scotia was paid $9.7 million and $2.9 million in bonuses, including salary and equity linked compensation, while the compensation for the CEO of the BMO was $7.45 million. The highest paid CEOs in Canada were from the Royal Bank and from the Toronto Dominion Bank, who were granted about $10.4 million each. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid its CEO $6.2 million. This information was from Bloomberg on March 5.\n\nThe Bank of Nova Scotia became the last of the big five banks to report its profits for the first quarter of 2010. BNS posted a profit just short of $1 billion, which is not bad for three months during a recession.\n\nIn total, the big five banks, BNS, RBC, BMO, CIBC and the TD Bank earned more than $5 billion in quarter one of 2010. The 2010 tax rate on that income is 18%, 4.12 percentage points below what it was when the Conservatives introduced these cuts in 2007.\n\nThose cuts to date mean the big five will receive a quarterly bonus of more than $200 million from other Canadian taxpayers. This is shaping up to be a year that will far surpass the excessive benefits the government bestowed on the banks last year.\n\nWhere do these banks get their profits? It is no mystery to me, but for those who have been living in a box for the past 18 months, I will explain. Credit card interest rates is one way. These interest rates have been increasing at an alarming rate. These outrageously high rates and fees have continued to pad the pockets of our nation's big banks.\n\nMost of us do not know that credit card fees are also a huge burden on businesses, yes, businesses, a group we would think the Conservatives would stand up for. Small businesses, which make up about 70% of the workforce, are a vital part of the local economies and communities. With these rising rates and the growth in new premium cards, many of these businesses may soon close their doors forever.\n\nProfit margins are tight in a tough economy. Keeping a business afloat is already incredibly difficult. These businesses are facing yet another challenge, this time from the credit card companies. New fees charged on transactions are taking a heavy toll on SMEs' bottom line. Some of those that are hardest hit are restaurant owners. Many are even resorting to asking for payment in cash only so not to fall victim to the creeping transaction costs charged by the big credit card companies. Many restaurants do this. They do not want to raise their prices on already hard hit consumers. Raising prices is bad for customers and their businesses.\n\nThe Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association estimates that the average cost of accepting payment by credit card is 2% of the bill, which is called interchange fees. This does not sound like much at all but let us remember that the food service industry typically operates at profit margins of 4%. It is outrageous. If a business owner does not want to pass on this cost to its customers, it makes life very tough.\n\nTo date the Conservative government repeatedly refuses to take action to regulate credit card fees; as always, on the side of big banks. Instead of taking real action, the Conservatives are holding on to the hope that these companies will follow a voluntary code of conduct for credit card companies, a code which even if they volunteer to follow, they can violate or ignore whenever convenient.\n\nThe government claims to be the champion of small business, but it always backs the big banks and credit card companies at the expense of people and consumers who end up paying more. It is time for the government to change its tune and impose strict regulations on credit card companies and to put consumers and Canadians first rather than corporate CEOs and bank bosses.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that while the Conservatives say their priority is jobs and economic growth, what they plan to do is entirely different.\n\nCorporate tax cuts, as mentioned earlier, do not create jobs. A company that is not making a profit, whether because it is losing money or just breaking even, does not pay tax. That is a fact. Therefore, when the government cuts corporate taxes, only the richest companies benefit.\n\nConservatives have priorities all right. Helping out their friends, not all Canadians. Whether it is with Senate appointments or secret deals with foreign companies, as happened in my riding of Sudbury, we cannot see the Investment Canada Act and we have had Xstrata lay off 686 people and at Vale Inco we have had over 3,000 people on strike for eight months.\n\nUnfortunately, the Conservatives continue to show their true colours and their out of touch nature with the average Canadian family.",

They spend money in our small-sized and medium-sized businesses. They use their credit cards.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, members will have noticed through the Olympics, post-Olympics and probably for many months still to come the multi-million dollar advertising budget the government is spending on its action plan. I am holding in my hand a summary of “Canada's Economic Action Alan Year 2”, published by the Minister of Finance.\n\nThis is supposed to be the plan by which Canada returns to a balanced budget. Unfortunately, there are those who look at the numbers as they are provided by the Minister of Finance and his department and beg to differ with the economic action plan of the government. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, as late as last month, said that the government's current fiscal structure was not sustainable over the long term.\n\nA budget is both simple and complicated at the same time. It deals with revenues, expenditures and the economy. A fairly educated guess is made on what the expenditures will be, what the revenues will be and what the economy will look like over the period of the budget. Frankly, the further time goes on, the less reliable are the figures.\n\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer is highlighting a very important issue, that the government's current fiscal structure is not sustainable over the long term. In simple language, on the basis of the government's projections for the economy, the revenues and the expenditures all that will happen is addition to debt. He states, “under the current fiscal structure, the Government's debt relative to GDP is projected to increase on a substantial and sustained basis over the long term”. Simply put, our debt will grow, it will grow in absolute numbers and it will grow relative to our GDP.\n\nHe goes on to say, “To close the fiscal gap, permanent fiscal actions either through increased taxes”, something the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister do not want to talk about, “or reduced program spending”, also what they do not want to talk about, “or some combination of both—amounting to 1.0 and 1.9 per cent of GDP are required under the baseline and alternative scenarios respectively”. That means that somehow or another some combination of revenues, increased economic growth and reduced expenditures have to amount to 1% or 2% of GDP. We have an economy of $1.3 trillion, so it is $13 billion through to $26 billion. Somewhere or another, we have to find the numbers in order for these numbers to be realistic.\n\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer goes on to say, “The fiscal action plan required to achieve sustainability does not need to be taken immediately”. I agree with that. “Implementing the necessary measures may be delayed until the economy has fully recovered”.\n\nAgain, that is essentially buying into the consensus of all of the economists that at this point it is not appropriate to take measures until the economy has actually recovered. It does speak to the long-term sustainability of this economic action plan and he is calling it into question.\n\nYesterday, the Minister of Finance took the unprecedented step of essentially trash talking the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, in my experience, is a pretty responsible individual. He has come before the finance committee on quite a number of occasions and lays out the way he sees the numbers.\n\nIn his report, which apparently so upset the Minister of Finance, the first point he makes in the first sentence of his report is:\n\nPBO’s assessment of the Budget 2010 outlook is, however, limited by the lack of detailed information and data pertaining to the Government’s assumptions that underlie the translation of the private sector economic forecast into the fiscal forecast...\n\nHe goes on to say that he is not disagreeing with the 20 or so private sector economic forecasts that were made. He basically buys it.\n\nIt is very interesting that his first point is that the department, the minister and the Prime Minister withheld information from him in order that he could make what we all need, which is an independent assessment of the statements and the viability that this plan projects. In the first sentence, he is taking issue with the availability of information.\n\nWe cannot have it both ways. We cannot say that he is wrong and then also say that we will not give him the information to look at. This is not the first time the Parliamentary Budget Officer has complained about the lack of information coming from the Department of Finance and this particular minister.\n\nThe report continues:\n\nPBO believes that the private sector economic outlook, on which Budget 2010 fiscal projections are based, provides a reasonable basis for fiscal planning.\n\nTo my point, he is not disagreeing with the private sector economists but he cannot do a full bore analysis on the basis of the information that has been provided by the Minister of Finance.\n\nThe report continues:\n\nPBO disagrees with the overall characterization of the Canadian economic situation and outlook in Budget 2010.\n\nEssentially, he is saying that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have put a touch too rosy expectations on the performance of the economy.",

It really means that he does not think that going out over two, three or four years is anything other than pinning the tail on the donkey.\n\nThe report continues:\n\nPBO believes that the risks to the private sector economic outlook for nominal GDP are roughly balanced but would not characterize this outlook as a ‘prudent’ basis for fiscal planning.\n\nIn other words, he does not think this is prudent. It is possibly not even conservative. Who knows?\n\nInterestingly, if we start to break out his charts where he goes through the first two years, he is actually slightly more optimistic than the government in the first couple of years. After that, the spread between what the government believes and what the Parliamentary Budget Officer believes gets rather dramatic. There is an enormous gap between what the minister says the plan is and what the Parliamentary Budget Officer says it is.\n\nThe report continues:\n\nPBO’s estimate of the structural deficit does not mean that the Government’s budget will not return to balance.\n\nHe is optimistic that it still could. It continues:\n\nRather it suggests that achieving budgetary balance would require: the economy operating significantly above its potential—\n\nIn other words, a lot more than what the rosy projections of the Minister of Finance anticipate. It continues:\n\n—the economy operating significantly above its potential; actions to increase revenues or reduce spending relative to their projected paths; or, some combination thereof.\n\nEither the economy has to really cook or the government has to be serious about its constraints on its expenditures or it has to utter the T-word. In fact, the government has, without uttering the T-word, actually increased taxes on a number of levels.\n\nThe government will impose a punitive 31.5% tax on income trusts by 2010. That of course is accounted for in the revenues and the government is anticipating that will be in the revenues. It has also put on a 9% increase in EI premiums, which everyone, including the Minister of Finance, has described as a punitive tax. That amount of 15¢ per $100 is accounted for in the budget and anticipated. Similarly, there is an increase in the traveller's security tax. Again, those are revenues that the government anticipates, even in its economic plan.\n\nAs I said, it is a combination of revenues, expenditures and the economy and how it will perform.\n\nI would like to think that this is an economic action plan but it is really a non-plan. What is more disturbing is who will actually pay for this non-plan. I would direct the House's attention to page 164 of the budget, which I am sure we have all read by now, possibly even including the finance minister. It projects that there will be expected savings of $17.5 billion over five years.\n\nWhat does expected savings actually mean? That is sort of like putting 50 cupcakes on the table and saying what a good boy I am because I only ate 48 of them. These expected savings are really kind of mythical moneys. These are moneys that we might have spent in another situation but we will not spend. In order to make the economic action plan work, we need to work in this $17.5 billion of expected savings.\n\nSuppose we bought that this two-cupcake approach is in fact a viable approach. Who is actually paying for this? The first thing we notice is that there will be restraint in the growth of National Defence spending. It will contribute $2.5 billion to this $17.5 billion of expected savings. That sounds pretty good, $2.5 billion on an annual budget of roughly $20 billion, so, over the course of five years, with $100 billion for National Defence, it will contribute $2.5 billion.\n\nThe next line is foreign aid. Foreign aid, on the other hand, will contribute $4.5 billion to these expected savings. National Defence will contribute $2.5 billion, and foreign aid, on the other hand, will contribute $4.5 billion.\n\nIn absolute terms, foreign aid will contribute $2 billion more than National Defence to these expected savings. In percentage terms, however, it is quite a bit more because the budget for foreign aid is flatlined at $5 billion for the next five years. Five billion dollars over five years is $25 billion. It is contributing about $4.5 billion out of $25 billion, so roughly 20% of its budget. National Defence contributes 2% of expected savings and foreign aid contributes 20%. That is a bit of a difference in proportionality. Who is actually paying for this deficit reduction plan, this so-called action plan?\n\nOur foreign aid goes to the most impoverished people in the world, so it would appear that it will be the most impoverished people in this world, who happen not to vote, who will be the ones who paying a disproportionate share toward these expected savings.\n\nThe next line is the $6.8 billion in administrative costs of government. I would be a big believer in that if, over the good times, that had been an administrative cost that had been constrained. However, from 2006-09, in other four budget cycles, what we have seen is a relative growth in expenditures of somewhere between 6%, 8%, and 10% on an annualized basis, which is just spending a silly amount of money over a long period of time. We do not really think this will actually happen, that there will be constraint, although there may now be a number of announcements of cancelling vacant positions so that we can have expected savings of things on which we are not actually spending money.\n\nIt is a little disturbing to ask the poor of this world to pay for our deficit spending. It is a little disturbing that we are not paying for it ourselves. That is where we are getting the expected savings.\n\nIt actually gets worse. Members will recollect that a couple of years ago this House passed a bill called the better aid bill. The better aid bill had three priorities: to focus on poverty alleviation, to take into account the perspectives of the poor, and to be consistent with international human rights standards. That is the law in this country, the law passed by this chamber but the law the government has ignored.\n\nThe government continues to set its own priorities. The minister has a new priority almost every year. In fact, over several governments, since the year 2000, there has been something in the order of 22 or 23 priorities that have existed.\n\nThe law is that this money, the official development assistance, is to go to poverty alleviation. However, when we look at how CIDA intends to profile its money going forward, it projects an 8.5% decrease to the poorest nations of the world over the next year. Not only do we expect them to pay the burden because they actually do not vote and therefore have little or no influence on what happens in this chamber, we are decreasing in absolute and relative terms the amount of money that the poorest nations of this world receive.\n\nA further 8.5% will be cut from assistance to fragile countries and crisis affected communities. Haitians have just gone through a crisis and it was amazing how Canadians stood up and contributed significant sums of money. There was a sincere outpouring to the nation and the people of Haiti and yet here we are, simultaneously saying that we will cut back 8.5% from the assistance to poor nations. On last night's news we were told that the government's so-called matching funds of roughly $50 million may well end up at the World Bank. “It is a possibility”, admitted the minister on television last night.\n\nWe say that we are helping these fragile folks. I do not even disagree with the minister over the staging of the moneys. I think putting $100 million into an economy like Haiti is actually quite disturbing to that economy.\n\nWe have an absolute reduction, a proportionate deduction and a reprofiling. Then it gets worse. Now we are going to have a 370% increase in the advertising budget just to say what grand folks we really are. I am sure the Conservatives have already spent $300-odd million on this, but a 370% increase in the advertising budget for CIDA when it is cutting moneys from the poorest of the poor is just wrong. It makes a very bad statement about our nation. It makes a very bad statement in this chamber and to the people of Canada, and it makes a very bad statement about the people of Canada.\n\nThis is an economic inaction plan and it is funded on the backs of the poorest of the poor.",

Five were going to become three and they would therefore be able to compete on a world-wide basis.\n\nThe Liberal caucus had quite extensive hearings right across the country. We listened quite carefully to people and ultimately recommended to the finance minister that he not do it. That is exactly what happened. He did not do it.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Scarborough—Guildwood for that fine introduction. I know he is waiting with bated breath to see how we actually reflect on this motion.\n\nI was just reading this motion. This is a motion that was put before the House on March 4, before the budget was tabled. I will read the part of it:\n\n....while Canada is starting to recover from the global economic recession, the recovery is tentative and uncertain and the number one priority of Canadians remains jobs and economic growth, now and for the future.\n\nI have been listening closely to some of the speeches today and that has been left out of many of the speeches, which I find very troubling. As we all know, later that day in this very House, the budget document was tabled, and its title is “Leading the Way on Jobs and Growth”. That is more than just ironic; that is a reflection of what this government believes is the number one priority for Canadians. I would encourage all members to remember that.\n\nWe were elected to represent our constituents, those who have jobs, those who want to have jobs, and those who have lost their jobs. That is why we are building economic growth, to make sure that the corporations are a fundamental part of this economy. As much as the NDP talks down our businesses, our corporations, it is they that create jobs.\n\nThe government's role is not to create jobs. It never has been and never should be. The government's role is to create an environment where corporations can prosper and they create the jobs. That is the fundamental difference between this party and at least the NDP. Sometimes the Liberals actually recognize that and we appreciate that.\n\nLet us refer to the budget document, “Leading the Way on Jobs and Growth”. First of all, we reminded Canadians of our promise in the first year of the economic action plan, and that was to stimulate the economy. That was with taxpayers' money. We were very prudent with that money. It was spread out across this country equally to make sure that jobs were created.\n\nAs I said, that was our number one priority, to make sure that as few Canadians as possible actually lost their jobs. However, those who did would actually have a chance at being able to sustain their families until they got another job. We extended EI. We put in another very important piece in that puzzle and that was work sharing.\n\nAs the finance minister and I travelled across the country in prebudget consultations, we heard from many firms that said they were seriously considering closing doors on some of their plants until they looked at the work-sharing opportunity. They kept those plants open and people's jobs were saved. Some of those plants are now back up to speed with full employment.\n\nFebruary's job numbers were released this morning and there is good news. We are not out of the woods but there are 21,000 new jobs. The February figures show gains of more than 60,000 in full-time jobs. That is exactly what our economic action plan year one was meant to do.\n\nNow we are into year two. In year two we are going to continue with what we promised in the first year, and that is $19 billion in new stimulus to provide and create jobs. The other thing that we have said we are going to do and which was laid out in the budget document is we will be providing a limited number of targeted measures, once again to build jobs.\n\nPhase three is about planning to return to budgetary balance. My constituents were more than thrilled to hear that.\n\nMy constituents are very conservative and most of them were troubled when we had to go into a deficit, but they understood that Canadians were losing their jobs, that it was very important that we step forward and made sure that the impact was as minimal as it could be on those people who lost their jobs. Now they are asking us and pleading with us to please get back to balance so that we do not pass on a deficit to our children and grandchildren.\n\nBudget 2010 creates and protects jobs through these proposals. As I say, our work-sharing program is very successful. To date 225,000 jobs have been maintained because it was possible to share them with other workers.\n\nWe are supporting young workers through our internship and skills development program. That is one of the few things the Liberals raised as an issue. We listened to them. The finance minister and I sat down with the finance critics of all three parties and listened intently to what they had to offer. A good suggestion from the Liberals was to not forget youth employment. Therefore, we put in place a program for youth internship and skills development.\n\nInnovation and training, education and research and development to create the jobs of tomorrow is what our future depends on. That is what our young people in university right now need to know, that the government is there to provide incentives for innovation so there will be new jobs in the future.\n\nAnother important item that we cannot forget, and on which we find the NDP members lacking in comprehension, is how keeping taxes low benefits jobs. Low taxes encourage growth and make us more competitive.\n\nWe will see that in the small and medium enterprises across this country. We have lowered the taxation level for small and medium size businesses. Once again in our cross-country consultations, we heard back from these small corporations, the mom and pop industries that employ most Canadians, that the money we left in their pockets allowed them to reinvest in their businesses and create more jobs.\n\nAs I referred to in an earlier speech, one of the items whose value many people are underestimating is tariff elimination. We started that step in budget 2009 on a select number of tariffs. That was so successful that we have put in place a plan to eliminate all import tariffs on machinery and equipment, on the goods that will be used to manufacture further goods.\n\nThat makes this country the first tariff free zone in the G20. To me, that is ground breaking. There are many countries that have tariff free zones in cities. In this country the entire country will be a tariff free zone.\n\nOf course, we will be winding down our extraordinary stimulus measures. That is a necessary part of our plan but we will be restraining growth of spending as well. We have special targeted measures to do that, and that is very important to Canadians.\n\nTo do that we will be launching a comprehensive review of government spending, administration and overhead. Many Canadians have had to cut back in their own lives, so it is only fair that the government, which uses taxpayers' money, does exactly the same thing and does it prudently.\n\nAs a result of that, by the end of the second year of our economic action plan, we will see our deficit cut in half. That should make Canadians proud of what their government is doing. They have asked us to do that and we have put in place a plan to do that. In year three, we will have cut that deficit by two-thirds.\n\nThe most important thing to note, as reflected in the earlier question by the member for Cariboo—Prince George to the opposition on how it had balanced the budget when it was in power as the former Liberal government, is that it did so on the backs of Canadians. It cut health transfers. It cut social transfers. It cut foreign aid.\n\nWe will not do that and I will reaffirm that we will not raise taxes.\n\nWe heard the job numbers and have reflected on them, and I believe I answered a question to that effect during question period. This puts us now at 160,000 net new jobs through the impact of our economic action plan. There were 225,000 jobs saved through work sharing. We have already committed 90% of the 2010-11 funding for specific projects, and we will see those roll out as we travel back to our ridings every weekend. As we get back into construction season, we will see the beginnings of these projects and more and more people back to work, more of the 16,000 jobs that will be created through these infrastructure projects.\n\nReturning momentarily to tax cuts, the opposition seems to think that all of the tax reductions this government has put in place are for corporations, whereas in fact $3 billion of those tax cuts stay in people's pockets, because they are tax cuts for individual Canadians. It is very important, when people's jobs are in jeopardy, to leave more money in their own pockets. We helped families purchase and renovate their homes with $3 billion in tax relief to do that. Of course, there is also our famous and well advertised home renovation tax credit, advertised not just by government but also by the corporations that were actually receiving the benefits and the people who enjoyed them. That was a resounding success. We even had people in the House of Commons who had voted against it come back and ask us to renew it. However, this government keeps its promises. We said it was a one-year program and after one year we ended it, just like we will end the deficit, temporary and targeted.\n\nLet us talk about how the $19 billion is divided up. There is $3.2 billion in personal income tax relief, and $4 billion directly for retraining and worker support, enhancing EI benefits and training opportunities to transition workers from their current challenges toward future prosperity. There is $7.7 billion for infrastructure to create jobs. There is that jobs word again. It is what we are focusing on, as well as modernizing infrastructure, supporting home ownership, and stimulating and improving housing all across this country.\n\nThere is also $1.9 billion for research and development. That is for the jobs of the future. Once again we are focusing on jobs, attracting talent, strengthening research capacity, improving commercialization, which is another topic we heard of in many of our cross country consultations. There is basic research development money, but we need money for commercialization to take it from the bench model to the actual product. We recognize that and are increasing funding for it.\n\nThere is also targeted support for industries and communities of $2.2 billion, helping create and maintain jobs in sectors like the forest industry. We listened to what the Bloc was concerned about. Quebec has a large forestry sector. The Bloc members asked us to put in a fuel system based on forest products. We put money in the budget specifically for that to help the industries, not just in Quebec, but it is certainly reflective of those industries in Quebec.\n\nWe are also supporting workers by investing $100 million to extend the maximum length of the work-sharing agreements, and are helping young workers, offering $100 million to support them. These are just a few of the budget items.\n\nI want to change gears, Mr. Speaker. You listened to questions all through question period and I am sure you are also wondering about some of the questions that have come up, and some of the false accusations suggesting that we have done nothing on pensions. I have been deeply involved personally on the pension issue across this country. It is disappointing and unfortunate that the opposition has been misleading the House about what has been done. As I said today, we welcome opposition members to the file. It has been going on much longer than they recognize.\n\nOpposition members are misleading Canadians when they refer to overall pensions as being a federal jurisdiction. If they had spent more time seriously listening to people, they would realize that only about 7% of private pension plans across this country are actually federally regulated.\n\nThe finance minister saw the concerns and the issues in unfunded, insolvent pension plans. In the one question I did get about pensions, I reflected on the fact that some corporations were in jeopardy of failing because of their unfunded or insolvent pension plans. The finance minister stepped in personally in those situations to save the pensions of hundreds of thousands of Canadians and, in fact, may have saved some Canadian corporations.\n\nFor anyone to suggest that we have not been active in the retirement income adequacy of seniors is very misguided. I would actually challenge opposition members. I will give them a little assistance here. I will repeat some of the changes that we made to the federally regulated private pension plans but I would be quite surprised if any one of them has actually taken note of what we did to protect pensions.\n\nOn October 27, we put in place a regulatory framework to enhance the protections for plan members, reduce funding volatility for defined benefit plans, make it easier for participants to negotiate changes to their pension arrangements, improve the framework for defined and negotiated contribution plans and modernize the rules for investments.\n\nSome of these old, antiquated rules on pension funds were very much outdated. I will give one simple example. Pension funds could not issue a statement to the plan members electronically. It had to be by letter. We can imagine the cost of that today, when it is so simple to do it electronically. Those are some of the simple things that we changed.\n\nWe put in place an opportunity going forward for these large funds to, in a tax-protected position, overfund their solvency. They can have up to 125% of their immediate requirements to pay out to their plan members. This was not available before and many of our plan sponsors told me that they wanted the opportunity to tax protect a surplus so that when we get into times like we did in late 2007 and 2008, they actually stay in a solvent position much longer and they are able to meet their commitment.\n\nThe Liberals have put forward some vague ideas about improvements to retirement income and they asked us to move on these immediately. One is a suggested change to the Canada pension plan. If they had taken the time to even look at it, they would have realized that the Canada pension plan is a joint jurisdiction with the provinces.\n\nWe are communicating and working with the provinces. We held a summit with the finance ministers in Whitehorse to discuss the federally regulated private pension plans and, in going forward, how to address the issues of retirement income adequacy for all seniors.\n\nHowever, the opposition would have us unilaterally interfere with provincial jurisdiction and make changes to the Canada pension plan without even communicating.\n\nI see that I am running out of time here, which is most unfortunate. I was only getting started on the pension issue and, Mr. Speaker, I know that for you and I, with the little grey hair that we have, it will be a very serious issue soon, but I will give a bit of a summation.\n\nWe will be continuing this consultation process with the provinces, which is the appropriate way to do it, in joint jurisdiction with the provinces, and we will be hosting another summit with the finance ministers' meeting in May, the culmination of our work and the culmination of the work that the provinces are doing.\n\nIt is very important that we protect these pensions because seniors have contributed immensely to the structure of this country. We owe it to them to ensure they have a good retirement.\n\nThere are many more things I would like to talk about. I have a whole list of quotes I would really love to get on the record.\n\nWe have had some comments today about our Parliamentary Budget Office saying that our budget was not prudent. I hope that I was clear in my answer today. The Parliamentary Budget Office is not being critical of the finance minister, it is being critical of some of the top economists in Canada. Those are the economists who represent the strongest financial institutions in the world, not just in the country. The Parliamentary Budget Officer should perhaps consult a little closer with his economic colleagues in those departments. He might come back and suggest that indeed those numbers are very prudent.",

He is basically saying, “What a good boy am I”.\n\nThe hon. member presents his so-called economic action plan, and says it is a wonderful thing, and explains how we are going to get out of it. Of course, those who might be a little but more objective about this, such as the Parliamentary Budget Officer, say that essentially the government's plan is not costed well and it has a structural deficit.\n\nHe refuses to acknowledge it and is unwilling to address the actual underlying differences between what the government projects as its expenditures and what it will receive as revenue.\n\nThen the Conservatives compound the difficulties of their fiction plan with a $17.5 billion so-called savings measure, which on both the face of it and in the disproportionality of it seems to orient itself to saving money out of CIDA but not out of any other program. The defence department is easily Canada's largest program, and its contribution is less than $2.5 billion over the five years. Yet, CIDA's is $4.5 billion over the same five years.\n\nI wonder if the hon. member can tell the House this. What kind of a statement does this make about the government, that its so-called expected savings are more than twice as high out of official development assistance than they are out of defence? In proportionate terms, that is a 2% contribution from defence as opposed to a 20% to 25% contribution from foreign aid. What does that say about the government?",

            "text": "moved:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should ensure that production management tools available to Canadian farmers are similar to those of other national jurisdictions by considering equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes by Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nMr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to my private member's Motion No. 460, which seeks the support of the House to level the playing field for Canadian agricultural producers with those they compete with around the world.\n\nI want to thank my colleagues, the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Health, as well as department officials at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency for their support of my motion.\n\nI am a farmer, a profession and career I chose, and a choice I am very proud of. It is a profession that provides to all people, not just some, an essential of life. That essential is food.\n\nAs a farmer representing a rural area in a riding in southern Ontario, the riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, the issue my motion addresses is significant and an important one not just for producers in my riding but as I have researched this issue, consulted with stakeholders and groups and sought information from government agencies and departments, it concludes and confirms to me that the issue is a long outstanding one. It is one that is continually hurting the competitiveness of Canadian producers from the west to the east.\n\nThis would apply to agriculture management tools which would include: fertilizers, seeds, feeds, veterinary medicines and vaccines that are regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. It would also include pesticides governed by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, which is part of Health Canada.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, let me give an example. I will use the United States as a comparative country since our producers are most affected by it because it is the largest trading partner and where most or many manufacturers licence their products.\n\nA manufacturer in the United States develops a new agriculture management tool. This tool is a product which will improve the health, quality, yield and competitiveness for producers in the United States, the very people that our producers in Canada must compete with for market share.\n\nThe United States has its own set of licensing and regulatory requirements, and so the company invests hundreds of thousands and sometimes even millions of dollars in scientific research in order to licence and register this product. The costs associated with the development of the independent science for licensing purposes is borne by the company and the decision to apply for the licensing and regulation of a product is usually made on the basis of a business case and would normally be one which justifies the expenditures.\n\nIn Canada, our producers look at this new production management tool and tell us that in order to be competitive in a global marketplace we need access to these same products. Then our producers tell this company that they want to be able to buy its product as well.\n\nUnfortunately, in many cases our regulatory and licensing process tells the company that in order to licence and sell its product in Canada for the benefit of Canadian producers, it has to invest the same hundreds of thousands and in some cases even millions of dollars to redo the same science, collect the same data, and do the same research in Canada that it just did in the United States.\n\nThis most often results in the applicant choosing not to seek licensing in Canada. That is because the manufacturing company looks at the size of the Canadian market, which represents approximately 3% of the global market. Our market is just not large enough to make a good business case to justify the expense of duplicating the science. As a result, Canadian producers cannot get the product and they are put at a competitive disadvantage against those producers in the United States who they have to compete with in a global marketplace.\n\nEven if a company does proceed through the licensing process, Canadian producers can still expect a very long wait for the product. In fact, our decision-making process can take up to at least 24 months which involves multiple production cycles in many cases and, as a result, significant lost income.\n\nIronically and most importantly, Canadians need to know that produce and commodities being imported into Canada, sitting on Canadian grocery shelves for consumption by Canadian families, most likely have been treated with these exact same products which are not licensed for the use by Canadian producers.\n\nThey have already undergone the research. They have been deemed safe by independent analysis. They have been licensed for use based on science, and as we know science does not change at the border.\n\nI ask the House to join with me in supporting my motion which will enhance the competitiveness of Canadian producers by providing them with access to production management tools they cannot currently access and by shortening the length of time it takes for an applicant to have a product licensed in Canada.\n\nThe way my motion proposes to do this is by considering whenever and wherever possible harmonizing our regulatory and licensing processes with other jurisdictions by utilizing equivalent scientific research provided the product not only meets but in most cases exceeds Canadian standards and does not in any way compromise our Canadian standards.\n\nSimply put, agriculture inputs are production management tools that improve the yield, the health and/or the quality of agriculture commodities. The fact that these production management tools must be regulated and licensed is a good thing and nothing in my motion diminishes that process in any way.\n\nIn particular, I want to note that the products I am referring to target the improvement of health, safety and the environment.\n\nI have had many discussions about this issue with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency. They know and understand the concern. I believe that they have been diligent in trying to address this issue on a number of fronts, including an initiative called enhancing access to pest management tools.\n\nThe idea behind enhancing access is to build on international regulatory co-operation efforts and maximize the use of scientific assessment and data that support regulatory decisions taken in other countries to register new pesticides in Canada. That is a good idea.\n\nOne of the first efforts under that program was a series of grower-requested priority reviews, sometimes referred to as project 914. These reviews were conducted on products identified by the Canadian Horticultural Council as being high priorities for Canadian growers. These U.S. registered pesticides were assessed using primarily United States environmental protection act data, evaluation reports from recent registration or re-registration decisions. I applaud these initiatives.\n\nI also know they have been conducting meetings with government bodies in other countries, with individual manufacturers and their representative organizations, and with Canadian stakeholder groups. Again, I commend them for all these good efforts.\n\nHowever, there exists a significant technical gap where most manufacturers focus on larger international markets and not seek registration for their products in Canada. These are business decisions in part, but they are also influenced by the uncertainty resulting from perceived or actual differences between Canadian, U.S. and other country regulatory systems for pesticides.\n\nMy motion seeks to bridge this technical gap by paralleling our scientific and data evaluation for our licensing process from one that some view as arbitrary to one which provides a clear direction, as expressed by the will of the House that we should, in all relevant cases, utilize the scientific research that has already been independently conducted for these products. This process should apply to new products as well as existing ones.\n\nAs a government, I believe we have an obligation, wherever and wherever possible, to establish a framework that puts Canadians on equal footing with those we have to compete with in the marketplace.\n\nIn order to do that, my motion simply says that we should be able to use the same scientific research and data used to license a product developed in other jurisdictions in order to license a product in Canada provided we do not compromise any Canadian standards. My motion reads as follows:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should ensure that production management tools available to Canadian farmers are similar to those of other national jurisdictions by considering equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes by Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nIn summary, with respect to my motion, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the Minister of Health and departmental officials at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency support my motion for these reasons.\n\nFirst, it would not in any way change, diminish, modify or compromise Canadian standards. However, it does seek to end an unnecessary duplication in the evaluation of scientific data and thereby expedite the licensing of production management tools for Canadian farmers.\n\nSecond, it would allow Canada to develop a parallel licensing process that would be more effective and more efficient.\n\nThird, it expresses the will of the House to federal departments and agencies that they need not reinvent the wheel by requiring the duplication of scientific research and data when considering the licensing of production management tools.\n\nFourth, it says to Canadian farmers that, as a Parliament, we are on their side and we want them to be able to compete on equal footing with the rest of the world in a global marketplace.\n\nFifth, it says to the applicant also that we can expedite the licensing of products, and this is a win-win situation not only for the applicant but for Canadian producers.\n\nSixth, it would not in any way affect Canada's sovereign right to make our own decisions.\n\nI say, in all sincerity for members of the House, this is the right thing to do. I seek the support of the House to adopt my Motion No. 460.",

Quite honestly, I have farmed all my life. It was an issue when I started farming and it is still an issue right now. We can do something about those competitive issues very quickly and easily. I appreciate the support, I hope, of my colleague from Malpeque.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion by the member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex and I support it. I will repeat the motion so it is on the record again:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should ensure that production management tools available to Canadian farmers are similar to those of other national jurisdictions by considering equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes by Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nI support the motion, but it should be understood that the motion does not really change anything. On the positive side, it might give a little more impetus to moving it a little faster to some equivalency, especially with the United States in terms of not total harmonization, because we have to protect our sovereignty as well, but to more harmonization in areas that make sense and that would allow our producers to be more competitive.\n\nAs I said, it might move it along. The motion only asks the government to do something. When the House asks the government to do something, the government does not listen very well. The record is, when the House is really strenuous, forceful and taking on a very serious issue, the Prime Minister might just close the place down. We have to recognize this is the reality of the world. This is only a motion, coming from one of the Conservatives' own backbench members, almost pleading with the government to do something, and I can understand that.\n\nToday the chief government whip got up in the House on debate on the budget. When he was asked a question about why there was not a dime for primary producers in the budget, he bragged about there being a little over 100 rural members. That is a wonderful thing, but they are 100 rural members in the backbenches who are not listened to. When they suggest something is falling on deaf ears, that does not do anything for rural Canada. My point is this is a motion and while it is important and I support it, we really need something that will force the government's hand to actually move.\n\nI certainly congratulate the member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex for providing some leadership on this issue because leadership has been absolutely lacking from the minister. At least we are getting a little leadership from the backbench. Maybe we are getting none from the front bench, but we are getting a little leadership from the backbench and that is a good thing.\n\nWhat would the motion do? The intent of the motion is to allow Canadian authorities to approve products already used in other countries if their regulatory process and their research methods to produce the data are deemed equivalent to those of the Canadian system. That is a very important point because we need that to happen.\n\nAs the member explained, and I will give a little summary of what he said, we have all kinds of instances where a Canadian producer is producing Canadian products. However, because maybe our regulatory system is slower sometimes, maybe the applications have not come in from the companies, or for whatever reason, the product, whether it is a pesticide, a herbicide a veterinarian medicine or whatever it may be, has not been approved in Canada. I believe there is a production plant in the member's riding.\n\nSometimes these products are even produced in Canada and may be more effective and cheaper. They are for sale in the United States but one cannot buy them as a Canadian producer and they may make that producer more competitive. Therefore, we are waiting for a regulatory system to move and approve the product but while we are waiting our producers are actually in a non-competitive position.\n\nThis is something that the government could move on very rapidly in other ways. The interesting thing is that the food, whether it is a crop or whether it is an animal product, produced with using that herbicide, pesticide or veterinarian medicine that is not allowed in Canada because it is not approved but is allowed in the United States, ends up on Canadian grocery store shelves and Canadian consumers consume them and our producers are not competitive. It just does not make sense.\n\nThat is just a summary of what this motion would really do to help Canadian farmers if the government listens to the member's motion and does something.\n\nIf the truth be known, the move toward bringing some equivalency and assisting our farmers in being competitive has been a long time coming. It started as long ago as 2002 when the global joint review was brought in by the PMRA, Pest Management Regulatory Agency.\n\nWe have had many battles, as the member knows, with PMRA at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food trying to convince it to get rid of the backlog, get products approved and through the system so that they are available to producers.\n\nHowever, I will say, in fairness to Health Canada and the PMRA, that I think they are getting rid of the backlog. I do not know if it is completely gone but they have moved some distance in getting rid of that backlog. I congratulate them on that.\n\nWhat really needs to be done? Pesticides, herbicides and veterinarian drugs that are available in the United States really need to be available for Canadian farmers on a competitive basis.\n\nI do not believe the member mentioned the whole area of seeds, seed registration, fertilizers and so on. Although we like to think we are the bread basket of the world, and we are great producers and efficient producers of high quality products, when a big company is looking at producing a seed, a herbicide or a chemical, it tends to produce it where the big mass market is which is often the central and western United States. A big company is not willing to invest money in research to get into a smaller market like Canada.\n\nWhat this motion would do, if the government moved on it, is put our producers at a more competitive advantage. As a result, it would not put the companies through the same huge costs in order to register a product in this country, which would be a good thing.\n\nA number of other things could be done and I want to mention a couple beyond this motion. CFIA needs more inspectors. One of the problems that is not allowing our producers to be competitive is that the products that come in from all over the world do not meet the same requirements that Canadian producers must meet but it ends up on our grocery store shelves. The government needs to spend money to hire inspectors to ensure that products that come in here do not disadvantage Canadian producers and come in under the same standards as Canadian producers must meet.\n\nIt is the same in terms of security measures that are being imposed on our Canadian agriculture retailers. We are imposing a cost on them that is actually paid for by the Americans in terms of their fertilizer and chemical suppliers. Those costs go back down to primary producers. The government could be doing the same as the U.S. and paying those costs.\n\nThe government could be doing a number of things beyond this motion. My only problem with the motion is that there is no way of forcing the government's hand. To date, without the Conservatives' hand being forced, they have absolutely failed the farm community. It is a good motion but their failure speaks for itself.",

That is the intention.\n\nHowever, given that the issue has been presented in the form of a motion and we must vote strictly on its wording, the Bloc Québécois must oppose it, because compliance with Canadian standards is not explicitly mentioned in the wording of the motion, and the member refuses to amend it in order to include a guarantee that Canada will not lower its standards. Furthermore, the vocabulary used is too vague and the motion itself leaves room for interpretation.\n\nParliamentarians were given a briefing session yesterday to give us the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nIt was strange that the briefing session was held the day before our debate on the motion, especially since the member did not really provide us with adequate information to allow us to offer an informed opinion.\n\nIt was even more unusual that the representatives—there were 15 of them—from the various agencies had prepared such a session for a simple private members' motion, rather than a bill.\n\nThe problem is that the motion is very broad and offers no reassurance regarding full compliance with Canadian standards. The motion leaves room for interpretation. We wish to avoid supporting the potential misuse of a motion passed by Parliament.\n\nThe member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is motivated by the competitiveness of Canadian farmers, who must compete against foreign producers who have access to commercial agricultural products that are banned in Canada.\n\nThe member claims that this motion is the result of consultations with many farming organizations and research into scientific procedures.\n\nThe problem is that the member has not provided any information about this research or consultation to the parliamentarians who must vote on the motion. Hence, they must do their own research and trust the member's motives in order to understand the intention behind this motion.\n\nAll the documents sent to parliamentarians by the hon. member indicate that the suggested harmonization process will be undertaken while respecting Canadian standards. That is true.\n\nIn a memorandum that we received, the Library of Parliament indicated that the purpose of this motion is to improve the competitiveness of Canadian producers by allowing them to use commercial agricultural products similar to those used by producers in competing countries, while respecting Canadian standards.\n\nThe following very clear statement is found on the website of the hon. member who is moving the motion:\n\nI am requesting through my motion that we consider using the equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes of other trading nations, provided that the results are consistent with Canadian standards.\n\nThe intention is very clearly stated on his website, but there is no mention of it in the motion.\n\nThe problem raised is that, although there is a desire to protect Canadian standards and to establish equivalent processes, this is not clearly and explicitly stated in the motion. In addition, the creation of equivalent processes consistent with Canadian standards must be better documented in order to prove that any differences in the two systems, although deemed to be equivalent, do not circumvent Canadian standards.\n\nApproval and marketing of production management tools is a highly complex matter that involves a number of laws and a number of different sectors including international trade, the environment, agriculture, research and development, and scientific and business ethics, etc. There are quite a few aspects to study and consider.\n\nThe consequences of a motion that is too vague and open-ended could be quite serious for the long-term health of humans and animals and even for the environment. It is odd to choose to take such important steps by presenting a simple motion that, on top of everything else, contains extremely vague terms.\n\nA number of laws would have to be changed in order to make this motion effective: the Pest Control Products Act, the Food and Drugs Act, the Feeds Act, the Fertilizers Act, and many others.\n\nIf the hon. member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex were serious about his harmonization plan, he should have worked together with officials and law clerks in order to deliver a real bill that would clarify the process standards and the real consequences of his request. We could have worked with that.\n\nThe problem is that, because he is simply moving a motion, parliamentarians have to make their decision based on the information available at time the motion is moved since, unlike a bill, the motion will not be debated in committee with the expertise of witnesses. What is more, the opposition parties have no opportunity to amend the motion.\n\nThe decision has to be made based on the parliamentarians' interpretation of the motion, as they look at the original wording.\n\nThe purpose of harmonizing the standards and rules for the analysis and approval of certain agricultural inputs, what we call production management tools, is far from being something new. In fact, with the creation of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the PMRA, NAFTA set up a technical working group on pesticides in order to harmonize the regulatory process for this type of product.\n\nIn 2000, the parliamentary Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development studied the issue of pesticides, their approval and their trade. The committee's report is very interesting.\n\nIt sheds light on the positive points of harmonizing approval standards, namely, and a few have already been mentioned: greater coordination of the pesticide approval process, elimination of trade barriers, a common labelling system, and competitive access to products that are manufactured on both sides of the border or in a number of locations.\n\nIn committee, most witnesses agreed that harmonization would make the process far more efficient, thereby improving the productivity of farmers in general and our farmers in particular.\n\nHowever, a number of experts told the committee that harmonization could have a negative impact by weakening standards overall.\n\nFor example, Dr. Kelly Martin of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment said:\n\nTo me harmonization has great merit. It is sharing information. Why are we re-inventing the wheel? I think harmonization in fact is pushing us in risk assessment upward. I think, in general, it probably pushes us upward... Of course Americans will always have a bigger weight. So if we think we want something greater than they have, it will take a lot of political will to do that.\n\nHere is one last point to consider: even though many witnesses supported harmonization, most of them feared that the process could result in less rigorous Canadian standards. Some standards could even end up being eliminated. That is the Bloc Québécois' number one concern.\n\nThis is what the committee recommended:\n\nThe Committee recommends that a clause be added in the operative sections of the new Pest Control Act requiring that protection of human health and the environment according to the precautionary principle be the sole objective of any action to harmonize Canadian standards with those of other countries, and that such standards not be weakened in any way.\n\nWith the precautionary principle in mind, the Bloc Québécois will not support this motion.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words with respect to Motion No. 460 brought forward by the hon. member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. As members may or may not know, we sit on the agriculture committee together, and I know that he is a champion for farmers and agriculture.\n\nIt is no secret that Canadian farmers often experience frustration at not being able to have access to the latest technology the way their competitors do. Therefore, the intent of this motion is correct. However, in its present wording it is vague and does not underline the fact that any harmonization of production management tools must meet Canadian standards.\n\nIn speaking with the hon. member, I am assured that the intent is there. However, it is not reflected in the wording of the motion. It could potentially see products available in Canada that do not meet our standards. In other words, I believe that applying a precautionary principle here would be a prudent approach that should be taken.\n\nAs it stands today, equivalent research is already being considered in our scientific and agricultural regulatory approval processes. This does not mean, however, that such research will always satisfy all of our safety criteria. The federal government should not be given a formal blessing by Parliament to relax our economy in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, CFA, there currently exists a pesticide technology gap, which has a significant impact on the competitiveness of Canadian producers. This is largely a result of one key factor: pesticide companies often do not see the economic value in registering products in the smaller Canadian market. According to the CFA, there are ways of addressing this inequality.\n\nThe Pest Management Regulatory Agency, PMRA, must continue to harmonize its practices with other countries and encourage pesticide companies to enter into joint or multinational review processes. The PMRA must also continue to modernize the review process so it can increase the reliance of acceptable foreign reviews to make the pesticide registration process as efficient and fast as possible, while maintaining high Canadian standards for health and safety. This wording does not appear in Motion No. 460. Also, maximum residue limits need to be harmonized at a faster rate to ensure that the required pesticide products are registered and trade irritants are eliminated.\n\nThe CFA also emphasizes that in addition to the availability of products, the other issue facing farmers is the price of these products. The fact remains that producers continue to pay up to 60% more than their American competitors for pesticide products. This needs to be corrected if Canadian producers are to have a level playing field.\n\nThe PMRA is now in the process of finalizing regulations that will outline the process for registering generic pesticide products in Canada. It is important for Canadian farmers to gain access to these important pesticide products.\n\nMy understanding is that the current system needs some fine-tuning to streamline the process. For example, as of last September there were something like 55 to 60 generic product applications still under review by the PMRA. Some of these have been there for several years. There is a need to ensure that as many of these products as possible are registered in time for the 2010 growing season, which as we all know is just around the corner.\n\nThe current grower requested own use import program was developed to assist Canadian producers to access the same products as American producers. Canadian farm organizations, such as the Canadian Horticultural Council, act as a nomination committee to propose pesticide products that should enter into this program. Farmers can purchase approved products in the U.S., apply a Canadian label to them, and bring them into Canada. Unfortunately, this program has not been as successful as hoped for because the rules that restrict the eligibility of products have made it difficult to get useful and important pesticides on this list.\n\nMotion M-460 is about recognizing as equivalent to our own the scientific research and regulatory approval processes of Canada's principal trading partners, such as the United States, for products used in the agriculture sector.\n\nI understand that the purpose of the motion is to make Canadian farmers more competitive by giving them access to commercial agricultural products similar to those used by producers in competing countries, subject to Canadian standards. However, the motion as written does not mention that last part.\n\nIt seems to me that the purpose of the motion is to enable Canadian authorities to approve products used in other countries if the scientific research and regulatory approval processes used in those countries are deemed equivalent to Canada's.\n\nThere are already agreements enabling product promoters to submit scientific data produced for the purpose of assessment by other authorities to Canadian authorities, but the system still requires promoters to submit a request for approval in Canada, and the data have to be assessed by appropriate Canadian authorities.\n\nSome people have suggested that Canada should automatically approve any product approved in the United States. Judging by the wording in Motion M-460, we can assume the author would support such an approach. Even though he said the opposite, that is how we can interpret the wording.\n\nThat is why I cannot support Motion M-460.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the government, I would like to take a few moments today to voice the government's support for private member's Motion No. 460 advanced by my colleague from Lambton—Kent—Middlesex.\n\nThis motion seeks to assist Canadian farmers in gaining access to many of the production management tools that are currently available to producers in other countries. Agricultural inputs are regulated in our country to protect Canada's animal and plant resources, our environment and the health of Canadians.\n\nWhile we all agree that this measure of protection is very important, we also need to be sensitive to the agricultural sector's need to compete in the international marketplace. If the approval process for these regulated items does not keep pace with innovation and leading-edge science, our producers will suffer an economic disadvantage.\n\nAgricultural inputs are, quite simply, production management tools or tools that improve the yield, health and quality of an agricultural product. Such tools could include: fertilizers, seeds, feeds and veterinary biologics regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. They also include pesticides governed by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, which is part of Health Canada. Veterinary drugs are also considered production management tools and they fall under the jurisdiction of the veterinary drugs directorate of Health Canada.\n\nThe Pest Management Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada produces data and prepares submissions to the Pest Management Regulatory Agency on behalf of Canadian growers for review and approval of new and effective tools for protecting crops.\n\nIn consultations, focus groups and value chain round tables, people in the agricultural sector have said that Canada's regulatory system sometimes hampers their competitiveness. They believe that the registration process is slow and overly bureaucratic.\n\nAt the industry-government task force on livestock in 2007, representatives from both the beef and pork industry groups remarked that the approval rate of veterinary drugs was lagging in Canada. Furthermore, Agriculture Canada's Growing Forward consultations identified pre-market approval processes for agricultural inputs in Canada as being behind the rest of the world.\n\nIn its 2009 policy manual, the Grain Growers of Canada encouraged the development of a joint registration process for crop protection products in the U.S. and Canada. Also, the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association website indicates that it also supports ongoing efforts to harmonize pesticide standards with the U.S. and beyond North America to ensure farmers continue to have access to the newest and safest pesticides.\n\nIt has been clearly stated by many in the agricultural sector that our regulatory framework can be an impediment to their ability to compete in international markets. One issue that is raised with some regularity is the perception that the Canadian government does not consider research and submissions conducted in foreign jurisdictions when it considers agricultural inputs for approval. The Canadian agricultural sector and the businesses that serve it wish that the regulatory approval process used in foreign countries could be leveraged to a much greater extent to expedite approvals for products here in Canada.\n\nThe motion before this House speaks to that very issue. The motion reads as follows:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should ensure that production management tools available to Canadian farmers are similar to those of other national jurisdictions by considering equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes by Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nI would like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that the motion asks that equivalent foreign scientific research be considered. The motion does not ask, however, that a foreign approval allow any such product to be automatically used in Canada. This is an important distinction.\n\nCanada is a sovereign nation. We have a unique environment, climate, flora and fauna. A product approved for use in South America, Europe or Asia may not be appropriate or safe to use in Canada. Our unique makeup of animal and plant resources, climate and geography must be protected. To simply allow a product to be used in Canada because a foreign regulatory authority had already approved it for use in its country would be hasty and irresponsible. However, a great deal of foreign research does have tremendous weight and relevance for our policy-makers and regulators when we evaluate products for use in Canada.\n\nThe motion moved by the member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex has great value for Canadians, as it should unite this House in supporting this as a formal guiding principle. It sends a clear message to the agricultural sector that we support its desire for a regulatory framework which considers foreign data and research.\n\nThis motion would lead to meaningful change. It would express the desire of the House that foreign science be equivalent to Canadian science. This would encourage regulatory agencies and departments to accept foreign science in support of regulatory submissions which would expedite approvals. It would also encourage agricultural suppliers in other countries to apply for Canadian approval through this expedited regulatory system.\n\nOther countries' production management tools can be registered in Canada, but they must meet Canadian regulatory requirements. One of these requirements is that decisions must be based on reliable scientific data and conditions of use in Canada, as I mentioned previously.\n\nRegistration by other countries' regulatory agencies does not mean that a product will automatically be approved in Canada, but submissions or applications filed abroad are often taken into consideration in the Canadian registration process. For some tools, foreign data and scientific risk assessments can also support regulatory decisions.\n\nCanadian regulatory agencies often encourage foreign manufacturers to submit their products to Canada for review. For example, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada look for innovative new pesticides and work with manufacturers to have their products registered in Canada. However, there needs to be more of this sort of activity.\n\nThe Veterinary Drugs Directorate, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Health Canada and the feed, seed and biologics areas of the CFIA are continually strengthening international collaboration to facilitate the introduction of foreign agricultural tools in Canada. This motion will encourage Health Canada to consider the work of other countries with equivalent standards and to use this work rather than duplicating efforts whenever possible. They can do this so long as they continue to adhere to Canadian legislative requirements.\n\nThere is also an effort to level the playing field for Canadian farmers with U.S. producers with regard to access to new or improved veterinary drugs. The Veterinary Drugs Directorate of Health Canada is working with manufacturers to promote same time filing of submissions in the U.S. and Canada. The directorate has agreed to align its review timelines with U.S. regulators for these types of submissions.\n\nWith respect to pesticides, where manufacturers once approached markets sequentially, they now routinely approach several markets at once, taking advantage of new, global joint review processes. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency at Health Canada has been a global leader in establishing the processes that enable these co-operative activities.\n\nThe CFIA is also very active in the establishment of international standards for those products that fall under its regulatory authority and mandates. A unified standard adopted by many nations is worthy of our investment and should be pursued aggressively.\n\nThe adoption of Motion No. 460 will demonstrate a commitment to supporting the agricultural sector in its desire for a more competitive landscape. The motion asks all members of the House to show their support for an important principle. We will support the motion.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to Motion No. 460, sponsored by the member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. I want to take a moment to read the motion. It says:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should ensure that production management tools available to Canadian farmers are similar to those of other national jurisdictions by considering equivalent scientific research and agricultural regulatory approval processes by Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nWe have heard from several speakers in the House, including the member for Malpeque, the member for Drummond and the member for British Columbia Southern Interior. They have all made some very important points about this motion. My colleague, the member for British Columbia Southern Interior, has pointed out that there is nothing in the wording that says we have to meet the Canadian standards.\n\nI know the member for Drummond has pointed out that, while it is not in the wording, it is on the website. However, I appreciate that the member has the correct intention here. It is a lot of work. Anybody who has ever brought a private bill or motion before the House knows it is not simple. There are a lot of hoops to go through. There is a lot of consulting that has to be done. I know the member has done a lot of work.\n\nHowever, there should be a better process around here. If the member was concerned about getting unanimous consent on his motion, all he would have had to do is check with the member for British Columbia Southern Interior, our party's critic for agriculture, and that would have been pointed out to him immediately. In fact, there is nothing wrong with the wording of the motion except for the fact that nothing in the wording says that we have to meet Canadian standards.\n\nHad he done that before introducing the motion, our member would have agreed to that and the member for Drummond might be a happier man today as well. That is just a bit of advice. Hindsight is terrific. One looks in the rear-view mirror.\n\nI also know the government has power. If this is such an important issue, why is the government not doing it? Why is it leaving it to a member in the House to bring in the motion? Clearly, it is not prepared to act. The member for Malpeque asked a question of the member—",
