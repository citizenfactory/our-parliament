            "text": "Mr. Speaker, the question we are debating at this time is a very important one: the future of air transportation in Canada. On November 8, Air Canada shareholders will be asked to vote on a purchase bid from Onex Corporation.\n\nIn order to properly understand the present situation fully, we need to go back a number of years, to seven or eight years ago. The government of the day, and the one that followed it—the current government—told us over and over again how important it was to have two national air carriers.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois indicated on numerous occasions that the policy being pursued by the government was doomed to failure, leading possibly, potentially, to bankruptcy for one, if not both, of the companies. Yet the government continued its market intervention policy, sinking millions of dollars into it, but was still unable to get one of the two carriers, Canadian, out of the mess it was in. It was a waste of money.\n\nThe minister we have today, he who had already done enough damage at National Defence, committed the same errors of intervention. He committed the same error of not making a stand and he did not propose a solid, logical and rational framework. So money was wasted.\n\nHe promised us a business plan. We have seen what happened. Only this past August did he finally say “We need only one carrier if we are to be competitive”.\n\nYet all those years he intervened, blocking Air Canada's access to routes to Air Canada when the demand was there, always in the name of healthy competition, which was being maintained artificially by the investment of millions of dollars in Canadian International Airlines.\n\nAt that time we said the real danger was most definitely that American carriers would seize control of all air travel in Canada, for one company as much as for the other. The outcome has proven us right. American Airlines intervened in Canadian International, and even has a veto on major company decisions, thus proving that the true control of Canadian is indeed in the hands of American Airlines.\n\nWe had said that such a policy would be disastrous for regional transportation in small communities throughout Canada and Quebec. Once again, we have turned out to be right. Service is not, is no longer, what it was. Prices have gone up, despite this supposed competition, at an alarming rate. It costs more to fly from Montreal to the Magdalen Islands than it does to fly from Montreal to Paris. It is downright ridiculous and it is hurting regional economies.\n\nYet the need for just one national carrier was apparent if we looked at what other countries were doing. There are only two countries without such a policy: the United States—and everyone will agree that the economic, geographic and demographic situation, especially in the United States, is very different from ours—and Japan, which also has a very different situation. In all other countries, there is a single national carrier for international flights because there is already competition internationally.\n\nRegional competition must be maintained, of course, perhaps by changing the charters of certain companies. I am thinking of companies such as Royal and Air Transat, which could handle regional transportation and would encourage the involvement of small companies providing entirely satisfactory regional service. I am thinking of Air Montréal, which is now offering fares from the Magdalen Islands to Montreal at half the cost of the major carriers.\n\nBut now the minister is changing his tune. He is telling us that we must follow market rules. He now worships market rules, and we have seen some divine interventions. The hand of God has taken on a Liberal form, and we have a Liberal puppet being operated by a corporation, which just happens to be contributing heavily to the Liberal Party. Here, we see the Liberal hand at work, and instead of talking about market rules, they should talk about speculators' rules, because this is what it is about.\n\nThese people do not care about the quality of transportation, about American control, about the importance and the development of regional economies. They are only interested in their stocks, they want what will bring them the highest return after the minister's divine intervention. This minister now wants to change the rules in mid-game. We were told yesterday that there are rules. A minister is responsible for rules. But this minister, through meetings with Onex attended by himself or his subordinates, is suggesting that the rules might be changed.\n\nIt is as if a referee in a hockey game were to change the size of the nets to accommodate the team he favours. We see it this morning—the editorial cartoons in the newspapers are very eloquent—this is not a minister, it is a corporation's puppet. He makes astounding leaps of logic when he tells us about what will come after the shareholders' decision—and let us not forget that the current offer made by Onex involves two corporations with more than the 10% limit, namely American Airlines with 14.99% and Onex with 31%. People will vote on that proposal even if the rules provide a 10% limit.\n\nThen the minister asks us to think about the need to change the rules. Logic—I would say honesty—dictates that we debate the rules, we establish the rules before the game beings, so that subsequently all of the players may be on the same footing, instead of telling them “Begin the game, my friends, and if things do not go well for you, I will change the rules along the way”.\n\nThat is exactly what the minister is doing at the moment. The scenario was written ahead of time. The government had discussions with Onex; it intimated that they could go ahead and make their bid, since it would change the rules to please them. The minister can then play hero here, saying that 31% is far too much and perhaps it should be 15% or 20%.\n\nOnex will then say that the minister has the public interest at heart, an interest that, more often than not, is confirmed at benefit suppers. The rules are being bent, so the company will accept the minister's decision.\n\nThat is hypocrisy at its finest, especially since, in 1981, if memory serves, on the rule of 10%, those opposite were opposed to the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec owning more than 10% of Canadian Pacific shares.\n\nThe argument raised by Pierre Elliott Trudeau was that it was unconstitutional for a provincial corporation to have more than 10% of the shares of a national corporation. The same thing is happening today, and what would have been unconstitutional for a province is apparently no longer so for a private individual.\n\nAnd yet, other companies like Petro Canada and Via Rail have such rules. Last year, during the debate on the banks, this same government said “Do not touch the 10% clause, it is in the public interest”. And what about the public interest today? What is parliament's role? Is this a “cronies' republic” or are we under the control of the people's elected representatives? There is democratic icing over a layer of nepotism in this matter. That is what the minister is doing now.\n\nThis is why we are proposing the rule of 10% be maintained. We can debate it later on. And, if the rules have changed, there may be other offers, but changing the rules in mid-game is unacceptable. This is giving preference to one offer over the other, whereas one is legal and the other is not.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this very important motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois, to the effect that this House reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions of section 6.1( a ) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act limiting ownership of the capital stock of Air Canada by any person or group to 10% of the voting shares.\n\nAs members know and as, in my opinion, the leader of my party explained in great detail earlier, it is up to us, the parliamentarians directly elected by the people, to those who received a mandate from the citizens of Quebec and of Canada, to shed light on this issue.\n\nTherefore, it is up to us to shed light on this issue, as the transport minister himself has deliberately kept us in the dark, especially since August 13, when he announced, with his colleague, the Minister of Industry, by his side, that he was suspending section 47 of the Transportation Act, hence keeping the Competition Bureau out of the picture.\n\nTalk about democracy. I think it has to be pointed out that, with this decision, the federal government put the review and consumer protection roles of the Competition Bureau on hold for 90 days. Instead of that, the situation has become extremely confusing for the ordinary person because of this suspension.\n\nYesterday, we heard about certain memos in a question addressed to the minister in the House. We heard particularly about a memo from Onex management to the company's directors dated August 11, two days before application of section 47 was suspended. I will not read that memo, but it said basically that the company had to get a clear commitment from the government before going any further with its plans, particularly with regard to various administrative constraints.\n\nA close look at the minister's presentation before the Standing Committee on Transportation, on Tuesday, and a close look at this memo helps us understand. I will say a few words about the minister's presentation, where he talked about encouraging competition. Basically, nobody is against good principles such as encouraging competition, nobody is against sainthood. However, people do not always behave on this earth in a way that will lead them to sainthood.\n\nThe government, through the Minister of Transport, tells us it wants to encourage competition as much as possible. “As much as possible” is pretty vague. In the end, the government may say it was not possible to do more than it did and we will just have to be satisfied with that. It also said it will take legislative and regulatory measures to this end. Then it goes on to say “The Competition Bureau will undertake a thorough examination of any proposal in terms of competition”.\n\nWhich means what? This suggests—and we will see the relevant legislation and regulations—that the government may be tempted to reduce the Competition Bureau to a mere advisory role, a simple role of offering an opinion, rather like some others, for example the ethics adviser. Everyone is familiar with the ethics adviser. When we did things up, the answer we get is “Oh yes, we have checked it out with the ethics adviser”.\n\nBy seeking extraordinary powers, the minister wants to downplay the role of the Competition Bureau, which has already proven itself in connection with certain decisions the government wanted to take. Let us not forget that the Bureau blocked Ultramar's planned acquisition of Petro Canada. It was blocked because we had a competition watchdog that said “The interests of Canadian consumers might be affected”.\n\nThis week, a most interesting letter by former minister Marc Lalonde was printed in Le Devoir . I need not tell you, Mr. Speaker, given your years of experience in this House, that Mr. Lalonde does not have the reputation of being a sovereignist, or a supporter of the Bloc Quebecois or the Parti Quebecois. Marc Lalonde is a former Liberal minister. The title he gave to his article in Le Devoir , which has a reputation as a most serious newspaper, was the following “The 10% rule: in the public interest”.\n\nCertainly the Minister of Transport, yesterday, tried to downplay Mr. Lalonde's intervention in the debate by commenting “Yes, but he is the counsel for Air Canada”. Nonetheless, Mr. Lalonde has considerable parliamentary experience and can see very clearly that there are two bids before the Air Canada shareholders, one from Onex and the other from Air Canada.\n\nIt is extremely important to clarify at this point that the Air Canada offer complies fully with current legislation and regulations. The Air Canada offer calls for no changes to the level of foreign investment, the 25% rule, or to the 10% limit on individual ownership of Air Canada.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the Onex bid, which would require both the 25% and the 10% rules to be raised.\n\nUnder Onex's offer, which is now on the table, American Airlines' share of Air Canada would increase from 10% to 14.9%. I would like the members of this House and those listening at home to remember this figure of 14.9%. This is no coincidence, and perhaps the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on Transport would be seriously tempted to come and call for 15%, since this has been allowed elsewhere, such as in the case of CN.\n\nAnother feature of the Onex—American Airlines proposal is that the president of Onex came right out and said that American Airlines would be putting up $750 million to buy Air Canada. The president of Onex would like us to believe that, even though it is offering $750 million, it will not be trying to exercise control and will not have a right of veto.\n\nMy question is this: Is American Airlines a philanthropic institution? Is it a charitable institution? Do those listening to us today think that a capitalist, American company is putting $750 million into saving Canadian Airlines for the sheer pleasure of it? Is that likely? I think the answer is obvious.\n\nNo one believes the minister. He is the only one who believes what he is saying. The leader of my party quite rightly mentioned Bill S-31. We will be coming back to this bill again during this opposition day.\n\nSince time is moving along quickly, I would like to point out that we see Liberal members from Montreal's West Island, particularly the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis and the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, who opposed the Onex proposal and supported Air Canada.\n\nI would like to know why they do not come to the Standing Committee on Transport and say so. This committee is sitting right now. Today was our eleventh meeting since early last week. Why do these members not come before the committee? The simple answer is that they have been gagged.\n\nIn closing, I would like to move an amendment. I move:\n\nThat the motion be amended by adding after the word “reaffirms” the following:\n\n“clearly”",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on a motion moved by the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie.\n\nThis motion deals with one of the components of the policy framework on the restructuring of the airline industry in Canada, which I have tabled before the Standing Committee on Transport and the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications two days ago.\n\nThe tabling of the policy framework that I made available the other day marks the beginning of the second phase of the government's effort to ensure that any eventual restructuring of the Canadian airline industry takes place in an orderly matter and with adequate means for ensuring that the public interest is met.\n\nSince August 13, when the governor in council put in place the section 47 order, both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, and any interested third parties, have had the freedom to develop and discuss any proposal which might lead to a conditional agreement.\n\nUnder this special process, three proposals have been advanced and two of them are currently on the table. Both these proposals present a private sector solution to the problems facing the airline industry.\n\nThe document I have tabled earlier this week lists a number of issues on which I seek the advice of my colleagues. The first issue is the one we are discussing today.\n\nThe government is asking the members of these committees to examine whether increasing the present 10% limit on Air Canada shares would contribute to a more vibrant Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nThe motion before us today is to the effect that this 10% limit should not be changed. The government has not decided yet whether it should be changed or not. We believe the question should be a matter for debate in Parliament.\n\nThe policy framework which I made available this week situates the debate in a larger context. I think the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie has forgotten that. There is little doubt that we face a consolidation of the airline industry and the emergence of a dominant carrier, whether by means of a merger through common ownership or by other means. This has given rise to widespread concerns regarding the lessening of competition.\n\nIt is for that reason I solicited the advice of the commissioner of competition on August 30. He gave that advice this week. I would publicly like to thank him again for the consideration he has given to our proposals and to tell him, through you, Mr. Speaker, that we are guided by his report.\n\nThe vision that we have for the airline industry as we enter the 21st century is one that is safe and healthy, one that is owned and controlled by Canadians and one that serves all parts of Canada at fair prices and that is capable of competing with the biggest and best airlines in the world.\n\nOur vision for the next century is that of a Canadian airline industry that will be safe and vibrant, owned and controlled by Canadians, serving all parts of Canada at fair prices and able to compete with the biggest and the best airlines in the world.\n\nIn articulating this vision and delivering this vision to Canadians, I want to make one point absolutely concrete here today, and that is the safety standards of the Canadians airline industry, which are admired throughout the world, will not be compromised one inch by the proposal that we have before us.\n\nThere is another very important factor in this debate. Fundamental to the identity of Canada is its linguistic duality. It is a reflection of Canada's unique culture and values that Canadians be able to rely on the national air carrier for service in either official language.\n\nThe government will ensure that the Official Languages Act continues to apply in the case of Air Canada or any future dominant carrier, and that the Act is effectively implemented.\n\nLet me now turn to some specific elements in the policy framework.\n\nThe policy framework that I outlined clearly affirms that the government will ensure that the Canadian airline industry remains owned and controlled by Canadians. There will be no change to the legislative framework in this area. The 25% limit on foreign voting shares in any Canadian carrier will not be changed. The requirement to be controlled in fact by Canadians will not be changed.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency has the statutory obligation to carry out an examination as to whether or not any proposal that comes forward does in fact meet effective Canadian control requirements.\n\nThe policy framework recognizes that Air Canada is subjected to another limit that only applies to that corporation, namely the 10% limit on Air Canada's voting shares that a single shareholder, Canadian or non-Canadian, can own.\n\nAlthough this provision has ensured that this former crown corporation has been widely held, some have argued that this reduces shareholder influence.\n\nAs I said on Tuesday, the government is prepared to consider increasing the limit—and only to consider increasing it—to a new level to be decided following input from parliamentarians—after debate here, in this House and in the Senate, for example—if such a measure contributes to achieving a healthy, Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nWe are pleased to take part in today's debate. However, we hope that the issue will be thoroughly reviewed by the committees of the House and the Senate in the weeks to come.\n\nI would want the debate to include the question of whether preserving the 10% limit is part of the consideration of the public interest. One could argue that the best means of ensuring that the public is protected is through legislation and regulation, and not through the 10% rule.\n\nThe policy framework puts emphasis on addressing the issues which are of paramount concern to Canadians. In addition to Canadian ownership and control there are competition concerns, in particular predatory pricing, airport access, ticket pricing, continuation of service to small communities, and the rights and concerns of employees. All these matters must be taken into consideration.\n\nFinally, I remind you that the government intends to introduce legislation very soon which will give it permanent authority over the review of any merger or acquisition affecting Air Canada or Canadian Airlines which is concluded from now on.\n\nThis formal review process, which is being put in place because of the importance of the airline industry to Canadians and to our economy, will involve the three elements of government oversight which are needed to fully capture the public interest.\n\nThe Competition Bureau will review specific proposals with regard to competition issues; the Canadian Transportation Agency will review proposals to ensure air carriers remain controlled in fact and in law by Canadians; and the government itself will ensure that transportation public policy concerns are addressed.\n\nThis process puts the final decision to approve a merger or acquisition with the governor in council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.\n\nIf a merger or acquisition is found to comply with the requirements to be owned and controlled by Canadians, as determined by the agency, the Minister of Transport will formulate the recommendation for approval, taking into account the extent to which the carrier has made undertakings to address the remedies negotiated with the Competition Bureau, and the conditions necessary to meet public policy objectives.\n\nThese are the cornerstones of the framework, but some work remains to be done before this framework can put into effect. That is why we have the debate in the committees. It is going on right now. It is going on in the Senate. We want to know the views of parliamentarians and we want them to reflect upon the conditions that we will extract from any new entity to protect the public interest.\n\nYesterday the leader of the New Democratic Party took issue with the 10% rule. We have this today with the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. I want to know why they are taking sides in a corporate debate. This government is not taking sides in a corporate debate.\n\nWe want the shareholders of public traded companies in the private sector to determine what is in their best economic interest, and then the government and parliament will determine if that agreement is in the public interest.\n\nWe will look at service to small communities. We will look at pricing. We will look at competition. We will look at Canadian control. We will look at how it affects the rights of workers, but I can assure the House that the government will protect the public interest so that all Canadians have an enviable travel system with strong air competition as we go into the 21st century.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to shed what I would suggest is the light of day on the motion of the Bloc to reaffirm the maintenance of the 10% limit on ownership of the Air Canada Public Participation Act.\n\nIt would appear to be a straightforward motion, but there seems to be a lot of emotion and intrigue behind why the Bloc would choose today to put the motion before the House. I would like to look at some of the reasons the Bloc might have done so.\n\nI would like to know whether the Bloc is putting the motion forward because of its strict adherence to the laws of the land. I would assume from comments given by the Parti Quebecois justice minister recently that Quebec would simply ignore the supreme court's decision on separation if it chooses. We know that separatists do not really have a lot of attachment to the laws of the land, so that cannot be it.\n\nI wonder if it is because they truly believe it is in the best interest of the Canadian travelling public. I sincerely doubt that, because if the current situation were identical, with the exception that Air Canada was headquartered in Winnipeg, members can rest assured that the Bloc Quebecois would either be in favour of changing it or indifferent to the 10% limit.\n\nThe real reason, I would suggest, that Bloc members are so concerned with this 10% ruling is that they see its removal as a threat to Air Canada. If the elimination of the 10% rule would be acceptable, what would be next? Would it be the clause that requires the headquarters of Air Canada to remain in Montreal? Even though the Onex proposal has ensured that the new Air Canada headquarters would be in Montreal, the BQ knows that it cannot trust what a boss who is based in Toronto has to say. The BQ wants to ensure that the status quo remains with Air Canada.\n\nIt is only with Air Canada that the BQ wants the status quo to remain. The BQ makes no secret of the fact that it wants Quebec to separate from Canada, that it wants Canada's national airline to remain untouched in Montreal, but it does not want Montreal to remain in Canada.\n\nLet us think about this. Canada may have one national airline situated in a city that does not want to remain in our country. Let us think of the chaos that would be created if the Bloc got what it wanted and Quebec no longer was part of our country. We have two national airlines today and all of a sudden we would end up with no national airline. That is the ludicrousness of this kind of argument and this kind of emotional attachment that the Bloc seems to have to the 10% rule.\n\nI would suggest to Canadians and to the Bloc that the 10% rule should never have been there in the first place. It is not the government's role to dictate to corporate Canada and to a private-public shareholding company in Canada, a domestic company, what limit shareholders should have. It is not the government's role to put those kinds of attachments to any kind of arrangement. Nor should any other control be placed there other than foreign ownership.\n\nThe crisis today is a drop in the bucket of what the crisis tomorrow will be if the Canadian government and the Parliament of Canada do not deal with the situation of trying to maintain the status quo. The status quo will not work. We have to look at options and we have to be open to look at all options. That means the government has to remove those things that should not have been there in the first place which restrict the ability of the private sector to look at the options and to give different ways of solving the situation we find in the Canadian airline industry.\n\nI question, as members can tell from some of my previous comments, the sincerity of the Bloc Quebecois in putting the motion on the table today and the reasons why it feels it is important to restrict the choices of the House of Commons, parliament and the government in looking at a solution to the crisis in the airline industry and to moving into the 21st century with a positive vision of what Canada and what Canadian airlines can offer the international community.\n\nIt is that kind of narrow-minded vision that the Bloc Quebecois has of Canada and its role internationally and its position with one another and how we can work together. That narrow-minded vision creates the situations we face day in and day out in the international community.\n\nI have great concern that the Bloc has brought forward a motion of this nature now to complicate what is already a complicated situation. I hope the House will determine not to support it and to move on with the discussions over this industry's situation. I hope we will look at all options and not limit it to one simply because of a mistake that governments in the past have made in trying to control private enterprise in the country.\n\nCertainly as a free entrepreneur, as somebody who believes in the open market, I find that any control that a government places is not good enough. I hope in future deliberations on how we we will help the industry through regulations and legislative change, that we will not move backward to a regulatory industry.",

I hope in this debate today that we can convince the Liberal government to support this motion as well.\n\nThis debate is not about which airline merger, if any, is the right thing for Canada. It is about something much more basic than that. It is about ethics in government. It is about getting the government to uphold the laws of this country. In effect this motion is asking the Liberal government to uphold the law.\n\nWe have a law in Canada called the Air Canada Public Participation Act. The law prevents any Air Canada shareholder from owning more than 10% of the company's stock. It is perfectly reasonable to expect the government to uphold the law. That is what governments are supposed to do; that is their job. Normally we would not think we would need a motion in the House of Commons just to get the government to do its job, but in this case we do.\n\nSince this airline crisis in Canada began, the Liberal government has not done its job. The airline industry is vital to our country. In a country as large as Canada with a population spread from coast to coast to coast, a strong, healthy, affordable airline industry is a necessity. It is the government's job to make sure the airline industry serves the public interest, not the shareholders alone.\n\nIt is the government's job to stand up for Canadians, Canadian communities and Canadian jobs. The government is not doing that. Instead, the Liberals have been flying by the seat of their pants making things up as they go along. The Liberal government's slow reactions have created uncertainty and made a bad situation worse.\n\nIf Canadians should be able to count on the government for one thing, they should be able to at least count on it to uphold the law. It should be a given that everybody in Canada has to follow the same set of laws, the same set of rules, but the Liberal government has not been doing that and has not ensured that that is done.\n\nThe Liberals are talking openly about changing the laws to accommodate their friends. I wonder if it has something to do with the $74,000 which Onex gave the Liberal Party and Liberal candidates, including the Prime Minister, in the 1997 election. I wonder.\n\nWhat I do know is that so far Onex has not played by the same set of rules as everyone else. The whole situation is incredible. First Onex tabled it complex takeover bid just days after the Liberal government conveniently suspended the Competition Act, removing the Competition Bureau's power to review a merger. We heard the Competition Bureau yesterday indicate that the reason this was done was that more than likely it would not have met the test of the Competition Bureau.\n\nI do not know how Onex knew that the Liberal government was going to suspend the Competition Act. Maybe Onex consulted a psychic. More than likely Ronald Reagan's is no longer busy now, so it is taking up some Reform and getting into that type of business.\n\nIt is incredible that this company is making a takeover bid, all the while assuming that the Liberal government will change the law for it. Think about it. The Onex takeover bid is technically illegal under the Air Canada Public Participation Act but Onex has just said, “That's okay. The Liberal government will just change the law for us”. That is like saying we are going to steal something because we expect the law to change to make that legal.\n\nI have known for a long time that the Liberal government is under the thumb of some big businesses but this is a new low even for it. I said earlier that this debate is about ethics. Obviously the Liberal government has none.\n\nThe government is supposed to be a neutral arbitrator. It is supposed to be the one to stand up for Canadians. Instead it suspended the Competition Act to pave the way for its friends and campaign contributors. Now the government says it is going to change the law to make an illegal takeover bid legal. It is completely unethical.\n\nI do not want to sound like I am being critical of Onex. I am critical of the process the Liberal government has followed. Instead of being a neutral arbiter and putting the interests of Canadians first, the Liberal government has bent over backward to change the rules for one bid. First it suspends the Competition Act and now it is threatening the 10% ownership limit.\n\nPeople are probably asking why we need the 10% ownership limit. Think for a minute about the name of the act we are talking about, the Air Canada Public Participation Act. The two key words are public participation. The whole point of the 10% ownership is to keep any one shareholder from getting a stranglehold on the company. Air Canada is supposed to be a public company.\n\nRemember that for years Air Canada was an extremely successful crown corporation. The taxpayers of Canada paid for Air Canada. It is clear now that privatizing it was a terrible mistake, a mistake driven by the Mulroney government ideology instead of the public interest. Air Canada belonged to the people of Canada and it was thrown away.\n\nThe Liberal government is throwing away the principle of public participation. Public participation is basic democratic value. No wonder the Liberal government is trying to get rid of it. It is in the business of eroding our basic democratic values.\n\nRaising the ownership limit above 10% will open the door for one investor to get a stranglehold on the airline. We cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow something as important as our national airline to fall under that kind of control. We must keep the ownership of our national airline as broadly based as possible.\n\nWhat is more, we must bring in a modern regulatory regime to protect the interests of Canadian communities, Canadian jobs and the travelling public. Deregulation got us into this mess and only reregulation will get us out of it.\n\nAfter 10 years of deregulation we have been left with higher ticket prices, lower wages and less service to remote communities. It is unthinkable that we could allow deregulation to continue in a monopoly situation.\n\nYesterday I was shocked to hear the Competition Bureau indicate that one of its success stories was that of Canadian Airlines prices and the American Airlines investment. That was its success story. Here we are today, because of the situation Canadian Airlines is in, and that is because competition was all that was looked at. There are things more important than just competition.\n\nOne group the Liberal government has completely ignored in the whole mess is the airline employees. The transport minister's policy framework was vague on the issue of protecting workers. All it really says is that workers should be treated fairly.\n\nWe have seen how the government treats workers fairly in Canada. In spite of pay equity legislation we have had to spend 15 years fighting the Liberal government fighting the law on pay equity. That means nothing coming from the Liberal government which, as we have seen over the last six years, does not know the meaning of the word fair.\n\nWorkers in the airline industry do not trust the Liberal government. They deserve concrete commitments that there will be no involuntary layoffs. No worker should have to lose his or her job because the Liberal government has run our airline industry to the ground.\n\nTime and time again the Liberal government has put the interests of friends ahead of the interests of Canadians.\n\nI have touched on many issues in my limited time here today, but the debate comes down to one crucial question: is the Liberal government going to uphold the law or not? Is it going to do its job as the government? This is the moment of truth for the Liberal government. It is a chance for it to stand up and say “Yes, we will uphold the law. We will stand up for Canadians. We are going to stop the special treatment”. The Liberals can do that if they support the motion and commit not to raise the 10% ownership limit.\n\nThis is one of those moments when each and every Liberal MP is going to have to look in the mirror and ask themselves who they were elected to serve. For the sake of the Canadian airline industry, I hope they make the right decision and join my fellow New Democratic Party MPs in supporting the motion to keep the public in the Air Canada Public Participation Act.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in support of the motion to prevent the government from changing the 10% Air Canada Public Participation Act to increase the available participation by any single entity. This is all being done in the middle of one of the most controversial issues we have going on in Canada and we should not be discussing this. This should not be thrown into the middle of the debate.\n\nWe have a great debate now about the future of our aviation industry and the process we are using is nothing short of crazy. This industry involves thousands of employees, dozens of airlines, hundreds of airports and communities. They will all be involved.\n\nEven though this industry has evolved over 60 years, the minister established the criteria on August 13 that we have 90 days to restructure an entire industry that affects thousands of people and many communities in the country. It is absolutely ludicrous that we could even get a handle on the situation. In the middle of that, he throws in a proposal to maybe change the 10% public participation act on Air Canada.\n\nIt does not make sense. The process has been mismanaged from the beginning. It must be ratcheted down so we can get a handle on this very serious issue that affects so many people, so many communities, so many airports and so many employees.\n\nThroughout the 90-day process, the minister has been changing the rules. First, he brought in section 47 which changed the rules completely for the first time and removed the Competition Bureau from the entire debate. He then changed the rules again and invited the bureau to come back in, only he gave it a very narrow focus, not the focus it was supposed to have and not the ability to do the job it was legislated to do which was to analyze competition in the interest of consumers and businesses. He wanted it to just analyze the one dominant airline theory. He did not give it the opportunity to look at all areas or to come up with other suggestions, he just focused on his one proposal.\n\nWe missed a tremendous number of proposals and we missed all kinds of opportunities to hear other proposals that might be more effective and more practical than the two on the table now. The whole thing has been mismanaged from the beginning.\n\nWe missed great opportunities when the minister confined the Competition Bureau to just look at his vision of the future for the aviation industry in Canada. He did not tell the Competition Bureau that he wanted it to look at all the possible permutations and combinations for restructuring the aviation industry in the interest of consumers and business. He took that legislated right away from it and instead instructed it to confine its study to only one dominant airline theory, and that is his theory. We again missed a number of opportunities there.\n\nThe Competition Bureau did an incredible report but it was confined and restricted only to the parameters allowed by the minister. If he would have opened up the parameters and allowed the Competition Bureau to consider all options, we would be looking at more options today. If at the beginning of the 90-day process the minister had announced that he was going to change the 10% public participation act, I believe we would also be looking at more proposals and other options would be on the table.\n\nLet us go back to August 13. When the minister announced he was invoking section 47, we had 90 days to come up with an answer. On day one, if the minister had announced he was going to change the 10% public participation act, I believe there may have been other investors, other aviation companies and other proposals put on the table. However, when they looked at this they said that because of the Government of Canada law they would not put a proposal on the table.\n\nOn day 74 of 90 days, incredibly, he announced that he was going to change the 10% rule, or at least consider it. That left 16 days for a company, an investor, a group of investors or consortiums to come up with a package involving $6 billion. That was not possible in 16 days. They could not get the approval of the boards of directors. They could not even meet their legal requirements. By not announcing the 10% proposal in the beginning, he precluded a whole lot of options. By announcing it on the 16th, he left it too late for anybody to respond to it or take advantage of it except for one of the applications or proposals that was already in place.\n\nI feel very strongly that the minister has failed to manage this process right from the very beginning.\n\nCompetition is the number one issue we hear about from consumers and people who have appeared before the committee that is reviewing the situation. The two proposals on the table now do not provide the discipline supplied by competition, the discipline for competitive air fares, air flights and schedules. Neither one of these proposals provides that competition.\n\nWe may have missed opportunities that could have supplied that competition. The Competition Bureau was restricted from analyzing that aspect of it and looking at other options that might be available. The Competition Bureau was restricted to only looking at the dominant carrier approach, which is the minister's approach.\n\nAnother serious issue is regional service. In the minister's five principles that he brought out on day 45 of the 90-day process, one of the principles he stated very clearly was that regional service must be guaranteed. The problem is that even if the airlines agree to provide regional service, some of the airports that have recently divested under the divestiture program are not viable.\n\nWe had testimony at our committee that 10 to 15 airports in Canada now are not making ends meet. They are no longer viable. We also had testimony from the Onex-American Airlines-Canadian Airlines proposal to say that revenues to those very airports that are not viable now will be reduced. How can we assure regional service if the airports cannot survive?\n\nThe problem is that there is no policy on this. There is no policy on anything. We asked the minister the other day in committee if he had a dual airline policy. There is no dual airline policy nor is there a single airline policy.\n\nWe asked about the 10% increase, although on August 13 it was not discussed or mentioned. There was no policy then. On day 74 of the 90-day process, he came up with a proposal that maybe there would be a policy on the 10% increase, but again, no policy.\n\nAt the standing committee and ad hoc committee we have had academics, flight attendants, airline representatives, travel agents and consumer groups. Every one of them complained that the cart is before the horse.\n\nThe academics say that any organized government would have an aviation policy, especially a country like Canada where aviation is so important. The government should establish policy and the private sector should make its proposals to meet those parameters.\n\nIn this case the government wants the proposals first and then it will establish policy. It is exactly backwards. In my opinion it is complete mismanagement of a transportation system that is absolutely critical to our country.\n\nYesterday at committee we an executive from one of the airlines. He commented that he could not believe that a G-7 country like Canada was debating a proposal that was, in effect, illegal. He made an excellent point. We are debating and considering a proposal that breaks the Air Canada Public Participation Act. We are debating this even though it is illegal. He was perplexed by that, and I can only share that confusion.\n\nMy position is that the whole process of determining the restructuring of the aviation industry in Canada is grossly mismanaged. We are in a pressure cooker. We have a 90-day window of opportunity. We are supposed to deal with thousands of employees, hundreds of airports, dozens of airlines, communities right across the country and economic development, and we have 90 days to do it. A person cannot even buy a house in 90 days.\n\nIt is not sensible to address this, but we have this incredible pressure cooker atmosphere created by a false 90-day window of opportunity which we think was inappropriately instituted.\n\nWe are voting in favour of the motion, not because we are against the 10% increase but because of the way it is being handled. It should not be injected into the debate when it is surrounded by controversy and all these peripheral effects. The issue should be addressed in the clear light of day. It should not be addressed when it is attached to so much controversy, this bid and that bid, and all the accusations that are being made.\n\nWe are supporting the motion. I compliment the Bloc for bringing it to the table. We would look at it again some time in the future without the pressure and without the undue influence.",

That could also change the percentage of foreign content which the hon. member has brought up.\n\nIf we break the agreement open, which this will do, then we break the whole agreement open and it is subject to complete negotiation again, and it is impossible to predict what effect that will have.",

In the case before us, the government seems to want to keep its actions hidden, withholding information from parliamentarians and not allowing all stakeholders in the airline industry to be heard.\n\nOn August 13, the federal government announced its decision to suspend section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act, a section having to do with the Competition Act, supposedly to make it easier to restructure the airline industry. At the time, the Minister of Transport said he wanted to allow the two Canadian companies to reach a mutually advantageous agreement. But a few days later, on August 24, 1999, Onex, in partnership with American Airlines, made a public offer to buy Air Canada and Canadian International and merge them. This is the real reason that the Liberal government decided to suspend the competition rules.\n\nIn addition, the government turned down a request from the Bloc Quebecois and other opposition parties to hold an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport in order to study the matter. The Liberal government also prorogued the session, delaying the resumption of parliament and thus sparing the government from having to answer questions on this subject that it would find very embarrassing.\n\nThat is why the Bloc Quebecois is today taking—",

Because the Bloc Quebecois is concerned first and foremost about public interest and the interests of Quebec in this matter, unlike the federal government, which appears concerned only about the electoral interests of its friends.\n\nAny restructuring, including a possible merger, should comply with current legislation. Recourse to section 47 and to various other considerations poses a great threat to the continuation of healthy competition in this industry.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois considers that competition is vital, because air transportation is an essential public service, especially in remote areas. There is no guarantee that control of air transportation in Canada will not fall into foreign hands. Finally, the Bloc Quebecois feels that American Airlines has a real veto on any proposal to restructure the airline industry in Canada, which runs contrary to the spirit of the Transport Act.\n\nWe also oppose it because there are thousands of strategic jobs, including many in Quebec, that are at risk in this matter. The Bloc Quebecois refuses to consider the loss of thousands of jobs a matter of fate and proposes that other scenarios be considered. The role of a responsible government is to take all these elements into account in order to serve the general interest.\n\nThe offer to purchase contravenes the Air Canada Act, which prohibits a single shareholder or a group of shareholders from owning more than 10% of the voting shares of the company. If the Onex/American Airlines group is making such an offer it means that either they are ignoring Canadian legislation or their friends in the government have allowed them to change the law to their satisfaction.\n\nMy interest in the air transportation issue arises from my awareness as the member for Jonquière of the importance of these changes for remote communities. While the merger of international routes could give us a sound national carrier, the merger of regional subsidiaries might eliminate competition in local markets, with the consequences this can have on prices and the quality of service.\n\nThe airline industry has a responsibility to serve communities across Canada. This merger would include regional subsidiaries, and the new entity would control 84% of the domestic market. Would this be good for remote areas and how would competition be affected? Even the strongest advocates of capitalism will say that a monopoly will almost certainly lead to higher prices, deficient services and a slow degeneration of the industry.\n\nI would not want my region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean to lose out on this merger.\n\nYet it is these same company owners who want to change the rules who are asking the government to suspend the application of the Competition Act and who want to change the rules regarding ownership.\n\nIn closing, I support my colleague, the member for Charlesbourg, and I remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois has asked the federal government on several occasions to pass legislation on political party financing similar to that which exists in Quebec. Until such a law is enacted, the federal government will continue to protect the interests of those who contribute to the election fund to the detriment of the general public, as seems to be the case in the area of air transport.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak this morning on an issue that seems to be dragging on, since we have been hearing about Air Canada and Onex for months now.\n\nOf course, during the summer, we were able to follow the reactions of both Air Canada and Onex in the papers and in the news, if we followed current events. Through it all, the government said nothing, did not take part in the debate, except briefly during the month of August, when the transport and industry ministers, with almost unhealthy complicity, quietly let it be known that the competition rules were being suspended.\n\nThe suspension of the competition rules had the desired effect, helping the government's friends from Onex to submit a proposal with the complicity of American Air Lines, in order to get their hands on Canadian International Airlines.\n\nWhat did the Bloc do during the summer? My friend, our critic for transport, the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, asked on a daily basis that the Standing Committee on Transport be convened to listen, comment and collect information that would be useful to the Minister of Transport. In my view, that is what a committee is supposed to do: give legal advice to the appropriate minister.\n\nHowever, the government refused to discuss the issue; it even boycotted meetings. Finally, the Bloc Quebecois and all opposition parties on this side of the House demanded that an ad hoc committee hold meetings. This committee was boycotted by the members opposite and dismissed as illegal.\n\nBut we went ahead and sat—during the summer, during our supposed holidays—here in Ottawa so that we could hear what groups such as the Airline Pilots Association and Air Canada's machinists association and many others thought of Onex's bid to buy Air Canada.\n\nFinally, a few days ago, the Minister of Transport simply told us that that was that, that everyone would have to decide, that it might well be necessary to change the 10% rule.\n\nBut this is unacceptable. This morning, the leader of my party, the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, gave a good summary of the history of the 10% rule, and we in the Bloc Quebecois think that this rule should not be changed. In fact, that is the reason for our motion this morning.\n\nWhy does this 10% rule apply to Petro Canada? Last year, in all the discussions about the bank mergers, why was the existing 10% ownership rule enforced? Why, this morning, does the government want to scrap it in the case of the airline industry? That is what we are wondering. This proposal strikes us as a bit strange.\n\nWould its purpose be to help a friend, the president of Onex, who is part of the inner Liberal circle? It is a question one is entitled to ask.\n\nThere is something else I find really strange. In my view, this issue of Air Canada and Onex is a major one, with particular consequences for those living around airports. This morning, I have some serious questions. What about the members for Laval West, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Verdun—Saint-Henri, Pierrefonds—Dollard? What about the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies? Are they unable to speak? We have not heard from them.\n\nI admire the courage displayed by the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, who sits on the other side. At the risk of being reprimanded by his caucus, he dared to tell Le Devoir , on October 14, that the 10% limit is appropriate and must absolutely be maintained. I admire him for his courage.\n\nAnd then there is the hon. member for Vaudreuil who was perhaps a little less courageous when he said “Maybe yes, maybe no”. At least he expressed a preference, even though he was trying hard not to make waves. Again, I admire the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis. He is not here just now, but that does not matter, I admire him nevertheless.\n\nI also ask myself other questions. Why would someone like Marc Lalonde, a former Liberal minister who must surely be respected by the Liberals, want the 10% limit maintained? Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you and Mr. Lalonde sat in the House at the same time. I believe so, and I am sure you respected him at the time. On October 26, 1999, Marc Lalonde stated many reasons why the 10% limit should be maintained.\n\nI agree with those who say that there are problems with Canada's air transportation system. We definitely have to ask ourselves certain questions. Is there room in Canada for two international carriers, namely Canadian Airlines and Air Canada? We definitely have to ask ourselves certain questions. But the issue cannot be solved in 90 days or in 90 minutes. A thorough review is in order. I certainly agree with most members here, including my friends across the way, that we must not let Canadian international air transport fall under the control of foreign companies.\n\nControl over Canadian international air transport must remain with Canadians. Regional air transport also must be restructured, as the hon. member for Jonquière said. Coming from Abitibi, it makes no sense to me that people in Rouyn-Noranda should pay more to fly from Rouyn-Noranda to Montreal than to fly from Montreal to Paris. It is crazy and ridiculous that a 55-minute flight from Rouyn-Noranda to Montreal should cost more than a 6-hour Montreal-Paris flight. It makes no sense, and we must review all that. Competition must be reconsidered.\n\nWhen the Reform member talks about competition, I agree with her that we must bring in sound competition in regional transports. It is indeed desirable and urgently needed. The lack of competition hinders regional development. It is much more expensive for business people from Rouyn-Noranda, Jonquière or any other region to travel on business to Montreal and back than to Paris. What nonsense!\n\nThat adds to production costs and results in products made in Rouyn-Noranda or in Jonquière costing more and being less competitive than those in the Montreal or Toronto area. The 10% rule must not be abolished.\n\nOf course, I will support the Bloc motion. A major restructuring of regional air transportation in Canada is absolutely needed.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague the hon. member for Scarborough East.\n\nAllow me in opening my remarks to refer to some prior experience in this area. I was the director of the Air Law Institute at McGill University for a number of years, and incidentally, adviser to the premier of Quebec on air law matters at that stage. One of the recommendations was against the construction of the Mirabel airport, the second airport. I think it was correct on constitutional grounds and also on air law grounds, although the advice was not taken.\n\nWe can move on to other matters where expertise also comes into account. This is not the first time the airlines have been before this parliament. In the previous mandate of this government the issue arose, as may be remembered, of aggressive litigation between the two airlines, the result of which might have been to drive one of them out of existence. This matter was settled by the intervention of the then minister of transport and in consideration of the use, if need be, of his powers which are limited but within those limits have a considerable range.\n\nWhat was essentially done was to use the federal power under international law through our membership in the International Civil Aviation Organization and our participation in the Chicago convention to grant or withhold approval of international air routes. A very felicitous solution was reached in this earlier problem in 1994 between the two airlines by opening international air routes to one as a condition of dropping the litigation. I think it was an excellent example of executive power being used imaginatively and producing a consensual solution.\n\nHowever at that time I did make some points clear, as policy imperatives, certainly for me as a British Columbian but also I think for all Canadians, that we have an interest in maintaining the extraordinary investment we have in highly skilled jobs in the airline industry. In British Columbia and Alberta there are 17,000 highly skilled technical jobs with one airline alone. We want those jobs maintained throughout Canada. Therefore any approach to solutions here must bear that in mind.\n\nWe also want maintenance of reasonable air access to distant areas of our large country that might not otherwise be commercially viable in a strict market economy.\n\nWe also want reasonable prices. If competition will produce that, well and good. If it will not, obviously there has to be a degree of government regulation of prices. But the opportunity and the facility is there. And we do want safe air travel.\n\nThese were imperatives that the transport minister understood, that he conveyed to both airlines and in the solution in 1994 they were realized.\n\nI have looked with sympathy and interest to the motion by the opposition Bloc Quebecois, as I say, granted the predisposition to examine every motion from the other side. But I do believe it does not really face the realities of the new world community of our times, the world revolution of our times which affects international commerce, international trade and international air transportation.\n\nMost of the rules of the game that we have now are posited on an economic trade situation that no longer exists today. We do accept the maxim that small is beautiful, but in the world of international air transportation even large national airlines in middle powers no longer have the weight or the size to compete effectively in the international market without considerable assistance from the government.\n\nThis is why I welcome the intervention by the Minister of Transport. There is here no legislation. There is an opening of a debate. It is clear that we are on the edge of the necessity of examining a fundamental restructuring of the airline industry to meet the new realities of international air transportation and the cutthroat competition that exists for much larger companies outside with much heavier government investment and support.\n\nIt is on this basis that we have joined this debate. I would suggest, though, that our national rules of competition are devoted to, directed and inspired by national problems. They do not, without some further examination, meet the new realities of international air transportation.\n\nThe minister's powers are limited in the range of matters he can touch but he does have discretion, so that the issue of relaxing the national Competition Act, which was designed to meet national conditions, to meet new international conditions is one worthy of respect and consideration by the House. We need suggestions on how we would use that discretion. I invite that from the opposition.\n\nWe must recognize that the international rules, even the tidy rules of the Chicago convention, those implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization, also need re-examination.\n\nWe have entered into an national debate. I have had visits from delegations, from Air Canada pilots, Canadian Airlines pilots, representative employees of the companies and others. I am gathering my own opinion on what needs to be done in the restructuring of the air industry. I believe, and I say this with all respect to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, the motion reflects the past. It fetters and confines a necessary element of national policy making which needs to be directed toward the entirely new and revolutionary conditions in international air transportation.\n\nIt is on that basis that I would not recommend to the Bloc pursuing the particular motion, an unnecessary restriction which hinders the debate that we now need on restructuring the airline.\n\nI return again to those imperatives. Any solution that the House may reach must maintain the investment we have in the highly skilled jobs in both airlines. It must maintain air access even to uneconomic areas of the country in strict national airline terms. It must maintain reasonable prices with competition if that is the case: two international airlines and one national or one international airline and two national ones.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion before the House which calls on the existing 10% individual share ownership rule to be restored and retained. The motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this House reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions of section 6.1(a) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act limiting ownership of the capital stock by any person or group to 10% of the voting shares.\n\nI might mention at the outset that my constituents are greatly interested in this matter. I represent a riding in the GTA which contributes directly or indirectly greatly to the health of our airline industry. We find ourselves inundated with various viewpoints on this issue and the restructuring of the industry that is going ahead. This is of local importance to my riding and my constituents, but it is also of national importance.\n\nOn Tuesday the Minister of Transport issued a document entitled A Policy Framework for Airline Restructuring in Canada . In that document the minister announced that the government was willing to consider changing the existing 10% limit in the Air Canada Public Participation Act, if such a measure contributes to achieving a healthy Canadian controlled airline industry. That is a rather important caveat.\n\nTo determine what role reviewing the ownership restrictions on Air Canada might imply in achieving a healthy Canadian controlled airline industry, I wish to speak to the cost of this rule, particularly the cost of this rule in the marketplace.\n\nWhat market distortions result from the existence of this rule? I would submit there are market distortions and the market has reacted in a variety of ways. The running of any airline is a very expensive exercise. The question always has to be in a public policy context: Are the costs of imposing certain desirable public policy goals worth the actual cost in the marketplace? The questions to my mind are: Are these restrictive provisions in place? How do they distort the cost of money? Do they achieve a proper public policy goal?\n\nIf Air Canada cannot go to the TSE on a free and open basis like other industries because of this rule then there is a cost and in some measure or another the market reacts to that cost. The question to my mind is an open question. I am glad the minister raised the issue of whether this cost is worth while.\n\nWhat is the effect? The market is already mutated to some extent. Consumers directly or indirectly pay for that mutation. I draw attention to the Air Canada proposal that is on the table. That proposal raises $930 million. Interestingly enough, at the end of the day those who are actually putting in $930 million only end up with 7% of the shares. That in purely market terms is a bit of a bizarre anomaly because the market has in some respects mutated.\n\nWe must recognize that the value of an airline is not in and of itself the infrastructure of the airline. Rather it is in other things. For instance, UAL and Lufthansa have agreed to acquire a new series of perpetual convertible preferred shares in the amount of $230 million. The shares will only pay dividends if and when they are declared on the common shares. It then goes on in greater detail. I would submit that is a distortion of the market. In addition, UAL and Lufthansa will provide a 10 year credit guarantee facility to Air Canada of approximately $310 million. How much that costs I do not know.\n\nCIBC will provide a $200 million upfront payment to Air Canada to deepen and extend its agreement. Air Canada will provide to CIBC approximately 4.4 million warrants exercisable for class A non-voting commons shares at $24 to $28 per share over five years.\n\nNone of us in this room are securities lawyers. It would probably take a great deal of effort to explain to us exactly what that means. Although the simple issue is that this is a reflection of the distortion in the marketplace, this is in itself a reflection that money has to be raised in the airline industry other than in a straightforward fashion. When money is raised in a marketplace in other than a straightforward fashion some kind of premium is paid.\n\nThe question to my mind still is whether the 10% rule the Bloc is so desirous of retaining actually distorts the marketplace and ratchets up the cost of money.\n\nThe first market distortion we see in this proposal is that the value is everywhere but in the infrastructure of the airline. The value is in the Visa card. The value is in some shares that UAL and Lufthansa want to hold, which are not voting shares.\n\nThe second distortion plays out each and every day, every time a Canadian gets on an airplane. Consumers in one way or another pay the cost because Air Canada or Canadian Airlines or any other entity does not get the cheapest possible money because the market has been distorted.\n\nThe third perverse consequence of that an airline, whatever airline, that is hobbled by unreasonable share restrictions and contradictory public policy decisions will inevitably fail or will inevitably be a weak partner. If we have learned anything in this debate, it is that whatever the future is for whatever dominant airline that comes into play it is extremely important that partner be a strong partner in the alliance. If it is not a strong partner in the alliance, it will be inevitably controlled by entities that will frustrate our public policy goals.\n\nI congratulate the minister for putting the 10% rule on the table. It did not descend from Mount Sinai. It is not sacred. It is not the Ten Commandments. It shows a great deal of political courage on his part to put what has been an effective mechanism to achieve certain public policy goals on the table in order that they can be discussed.\n\nIf the minister asks me what is the value of this rule, my response would be that he should tell me what is the cost of the 10% rule to the airlines and therefore to their consumers. If there are other ways to achieve the same goal, either de facto control or de jure control or effective control, and we have a variety of tests for those things, then let us achieve it that way. Let us not ruin the marketplace by putting in artificial unsustainable rules.\n\nAnother reality is that whatever dominant airline emerges it will be part of an alliance. If this “new company” is hobbled by some useless public policy initiative, it will inevitably lead to difficulties with that airline. Then we will be back to this debate again and we will be back to trying to figure out how to bail out the new airline one way or another.\n\nIf this rule does not stand that litmus test, then my view is, let the rule go.\n\nThe 10% rule in essence is a share restriction, and a share restriction distorts the market. When market distortion occurs it costs money. The cost goes not only to the shareholders of the airline, it also goes to the consuming public. If that cannot be justified, then the rule should not stand.\n\nOn the basis of that I suggest that the motion should fail and that hon. members should not support the motion. In fact, the minister's positioning on this is correct, it is an area which needs to be discussed. If we can achieve public policy goals by other means, then I would be open to that idea.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am most enthusiastic about taking part in this debate, which is an extremely important one, in my opinion.\n\nAll debates are important, in my opinion, but this one is of vital importance for those who work in the airline industry, and for the consumers, those who fly. It is vital as well for economic and regional development, for all these aspects are interrelated.\n\nSince the first speech by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, I have listened carefully to everything the representatives of the other parties have had to say. I am delighted that the Progressive Conservative Party and the NDP have declared their intention of backing the motion by the member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. This pleases me a great deal.\n\nHowever, representatives of the other parties—the Liberals of course, and the Reformers—have said they were opposed. As far as Reform is concerned, one could doubt their consistency, as it seems to vary depending on the subject, but in this case their point of view is clear.\n\nThe Reform member who has just spoken referred to the interests of the west. She did not seem to be upset by the fact that the Americans want to get their hands on more shares in the airlines.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois' position is consistent with earlier government decisions in certain areas. In the case of the banks, or other sectors of the economy, the 10% rule was enforced. The exception was CN, where the government allowed up to 15%. The Bloc Quebecois was not in agreement.\n\nWe have therefore always been consistent. If the rule is 10%, we are not going to change it to suit the circumstances. We therefore have to wonder why the Minister of Transport said, before Air Canada shareholders have cast their votes at the November 8 meeting, “Things are changing, and we must too”.\n\nWhy change at this particular time, when we know that not a session goes by—at least, not since I have been in parliament— that the situation in the airline industry is not discussed in one way or another?\n\nThere have been questions from all the opposition parties. The government had things to say as well. Everyone was concerned about the future of Air Canada and of Canadian International Airlines. So why, at this particular time, is the government, while claiming not to want to intervene, suggesting that, before shareholders make their fateful decision on November 8, it would now be prepared to change the 10% rule?\n\nAnd the suggestion was not made by just anybody. Not by an official, a backbencher or a parliamentary secretary, but by the Minister of Transport himself. So, he is speaking on behalf of Cabinet. So, they have discussed the matter.\n\nWhen we look at the series of events that have occurred since August 13, we can see that, in the end, we are in a context in which the government has decided to make a choice. It has waited for just the right moment. Why? Because Onex is involved. It knew that Onex was prepared to act. The government, according to us—at least that is what I think—the government is changing its tune, and now it would like to help Onex with its project. Since it does not want to do so overtly, it is doing so covertly.\n\nDoing covertly what one cannot do overtly is not being transparent. It is acting. It is a scenario that would do for a great film. It is a strategy that does not fool the members of the Bloc Quebecois or the media, and commentators who are following the story closely.\n\nIt is part of a well formulated plan. The way things are going, since the parties on both sides are following this debate even more closely than the average citizen, it is clear that they know how to decode the messages sent them by the government. This ability will significantly influence the results of the general meeting of Air Canada shareholders. At least, it can change it a lot.\n\nSo, while the government did not intervene in any way, the Air Canada shareholders will have only one option on November 8: accept or reject Air Canada's offer, since it is the only one that goes by the rules.\n\nThere is however one principle at stake, the one according to which we must act in the best interests of all Canadians and of all Quebecers. It is therefore a matter of interest. We must ask ourselves in whose best interests the Minister of Transport was acting when he made his position known on Tuesday.\n\nI am talking about the position he indirectly took when he suggested that he was ready to consider changing the rules. What purpose would that serve? To enhance services? To protect as many jobs as possible? To promote the interests of some shareholders? To promote the interests of a handful of government buddies perhaps?\n\nWe do not know. We are asking the question. Today's debate gives us the opportunity to ask this question. The Bloc Quebecois is wondering in whose best interests the government is acting.\n\nThis is a rather simple question, at least to us in the Bloc. We have always stated, and we keep reminding people, that we are here—because we only ran candidates in Quebec—to protect the interests of Quebec. We are here first and foremost to protect the interests of our province. Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International are Canadian companies, and competition should be given free reign.\n\nI am surprised to see that our colleagues from the Reform Party, who always saw the competition rule as a protection for consumers, now seem to be supporting the new way of thinking of the transport minister, who is announcing in advance what he intends to do to encourage certain people who have interests or shares in these companies.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois' position is clear: we want the competition rule to be maintained. Obviously, we do not want to see any company disappear. In this era of economic liberalism, performance and the quality of goods and services are the main factors that will make or break a company, and that has to remain.\n\nEven if we had only one major air carrier, there would still be competition because other international carriers fly to Canada, and there are regional carriers that are not affiliated with Air Canada or Canadian International Airlines. For example, starting November 1, Air Montreal will serve Quebec and Ottawa. Therefore, there are opportunities for the regions also, and one sound company that provides good services is better than two that are struggling to survive.",

Yet, for two days, the ad hoc committee heard from witnesses who came from all over Canada to raise members' awareness about the importance of restructuring air transportation services in Canada.\n\nConsidering the seriousness of all those people, the Bloc Quebecois introduced a motion today. That motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this House reaffirms its desire to maintain the provisions of section 6.1( a ) of the Air Canada Public Participation Act limiting ownership of the capital stock of Air Canada by any person or group to 10% of the voting shares.\n\nOf course, the Bloc Quebecois explained its position which is that the role of a responsible government is to act like a referee whose primary concern is protection of the public interest. Changing the act would favour one party over the other and that is called cheating. If the government changes the act to suit Onex or AMR, that would send the signal that private companies do not have to comply with the law but that the government has to adapt the law to suit its friends.\n\nThe 10% rule applies to Petro Canada, banks and several other public interest corporations. Changing that rule would be contrary to public interest. The 10% rule was put in place to prevent a single group from gaining control of Air Canada, one of the two national air carriers. The government wants to change the rule to allow a group to gain control of the only remaining carrier. That would be putting the future of the air carrier in the hands of only one group. By refusing to state its position, the government is feeding the uncertainty that currently exists in the airline industry.\n\nOf course the committee has a clear mandate, witnesses to hear, hearings to hold. I hope this time the Minister of Transport is going to listen to the committee's recommendations. We know what happened when it was time to restructure the shipping industry. Every political party had an input and made recommendations to the minister. I am convinced unfortunately that he had already made up his mind on how the shipping industry was going to be restructured, even before the committee sat down to write its report.\n\nAs I said earlier in my speech, we are going through very turbulent times and Canadians are very concerned. When a plane is going through turbulence or a storm, people on board are worried and feel powerless.\n\nOur constituents, who are watching us, who sent us here to represent them, are concerned about the future of air transportation, especially in the regions. Under the bid of Onex or AMR, the merger of Air Canada and Canadian could result in the loss of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs. According to the president of Air Canada, Air Canada's offer to merge with Canadian could mean the loss of around 2,500 jobs. If the government does nothing, Canadian will likely go under and all its workers will lose their jobs.\n\nWhat we in the Bloc Quebecois want is to maintain as many jobs as possible while ensuring the highest quality of service in the airline industry.\n\nLater this week in committee I will ask the Minister of Transport the following question “Should there be a merger, what do you think the future of air transportation in the regions will be?” As you know, air transportation is of paramount importance in the regions. And yet, over the last few years, air service in the regions has been diminishing. Quality of service is in jeopardy, and flight frequency is left up to individual carriers.\n\nFor those who have no choice, plane tickets are very expensive. In a riding like Charlevoix, on the north shore, air transportation is the fastest way to get around, because we have no rail transportation and we have only one access road. Therefore, the only way to travel fast is by plane, and carriers know it only too well.\n\nTravellers who have no choice use a particular type of service, for professional reasons. They are, for example, business people who need to travel within a very short timeframe or people from the regions who need to go to Quebec City or to Montreal to have access to certain health care services.\n\nThe merger of Air Canada and Canadian International Airlines is of great concern to us, especially the Onex proposal, because I think there is some kind of complicity between the Department of Transport, Canadian International Airlines and the future company.\n\nWith regard to the future of regional air service, we all know that airports are already losing money. If the number of flights to regional airports is reduced, we will no longer have what we have now, that is a red and white Air Alliance plane arriving at 8.55 a.m. and a blue and white Canadian Airlines plane arriving at 9.10 a.m. Some will say that the blue and white plane was half full and the other one was half empty, depending on which company they want to support.\n\nWe know that the number of flights is what makes an airport profitable. This means that a merger would reduce the profitability of airports by at least 50%. And when I think about what happened when the Department of Transport made Nav Canada responsible for airport management in order to reduce airport deficits, if the past is any indication of what we can expect in the future, then I am extremely worried.\n\nWe all know that Nav Canada cut services at airports by reducing the number of air traffic controllers, by closing control towers, by cutting airport firefighting services, all at the expense of passenger safety.\n\nI see that my time is up. I could have gone on for at least another 40 minutes, but I will have the opportunity to come back to this later on.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion to affirm the 10% limit on individual holdings of voting shares in Air Canada.\n\nMr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.\n\nI want to remind the House that on October 26 the transport minister issued a policy framework for the restructuring of the airline industry in Canada in which the percentage limit on individual holdings of Air Canada was addressed. In his remarks to the Standing Committee on Transport the minister reiterated the government's willingness to consider increasing the limit to a new level, to be decided following input from parliamentarians, if such a measure were to contribute to achieving a healthy Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nThat is important. A healthy and viable industry is one in which airlines are financially fit and competing both domestically and internationally. However, in view of the circumstances in the air travel marketplace, a restructuring of Canada's airline industry resulting in one dominant airline appears likely.\n\nConfronted with the probability of major changes to the airline industry, Canadians have been very active and vocal in expressing their views and concerns, and rightfully so. The transport minister and his officials have met with numerous direct stakeholders, have consulted with interest groups and members of the public and have received views through correspondence and other ways of getting in contact. A wide of variety of important concerns have been expressed by Canadians confirming the need for a clear government role in any restructuring of the airline industry.\n\nI am proud to say that the government has listened carefully to Canadians and has developed a framework outlining our approach to protecting the public interest.\n\nOne aspect of the public interest that has received substantial attention is the predicted lessening of competition as a result of a major consolidation of airlines. Most Canadians want Canada's airline industry to be competitive. We have heard that and we have listened. They believe that competition is an effective way to ensure reasonable airfares and good quality air service. The government continues to agree with Canadians in this regard.\n\nEarly in the process the transport minister solicited the assistance of the Competition Bureau. The commissioner of the bureau submitted his report on October 22 to the Minister of Transport. The commissioner's analysis and recommendations were thoroughly considered by the minister, as a study of the policy framework will show.\n\nThe government is committed to fostering as much competition as possible in the airline industry in Canada. That is precisely what we are doing. We are convinced that reducing the barriers to market entry for new carriers and encouraging existing carriers to expand into new markets will mitigate the expected lessening of competition that may result from a consolidation in the industry. That is why the Minister of Transport announced the government's intention to take policy and regulatory steps to address competition issues.\n\nFrequent flyer programs, for example, that have a significant influence on the air services that consumers choose, are a concern for competition. Other carriers would be greatly disadvantaged if they could not offer or redeem points in a dominant carrier's plan. The potential negative effects could be mitigated by allowing any domestic carrier to purchase points in the dominant carrier's frequent flyer plan at a reasonable cost, or by the dominant carrier's participation in independent loyalty programs.\n\nThe great majority of flight bookings still go through travel agents. If agents are constrained from booking on other airlines for fear of not achieving the target set for their override commission by the dominant carrier, competition would be undermined. The government will examine ways to address the anti-competitive effects of this issue while recognizing the potential impact on travel agent revenues.\n\nAny restructuring of the airline industry is expected to include some rationalization of services, particularly in the domestic market, such that the dominant carrier may no longer need all the aircraft in its fleet. These aircraft, already certified for safe operation in Canada, might be very attractive to other Canadian carriers. There is a risk, however, that the dominant carrier would prefer to divest any surplus aircraft offshore. If rights of first refusal for surplus aircraft on reasonable commercial terms were offered to an interested party in the domestic market during the restructuring process, this could assist in fostering more consumer choice.\n\nIndependent airlines may have little choice but to work with the dominant carrier when their passengers need a connecting flight to get to their final destination. A smooth exchange of passengers and their baggage, however, requires the co-operation of the dominant airline. If access to feed traffic and interlining were offered to unaffiliated regional and chartered carriers on commercially reasonable terms, this could help regional carriers to continue to function effectively. This is certainly a goal of the government.\n\nBoth major airlines have developed close commercial relations with regional affiliates or partner airlines to ensure that smaller communities are well integrated into their network. After all, that is what Canada is all about.\n\nIn these arrangements it is common for the larger carrier to provide such essential services as airport slots and facilities, aircraft leases, reservation systems, ticket processing, revenue collection and accounting. However, it is not clear whether all of the smaller regional carriers will remain connected to the dominant carrier in any restructuring. If any do not, they will need a period of adjustment so that they may replace essential services previously provided by larger partners.\n\nFor regional carriers formerly dependent on one of the two major carriers for essential services, if the dominant carrier were to continue to provide these services for a reasonable period of time at prices no less favourable than currently in place, this would help ensure continued service. Where feasible, the dominant carrier might also continue to provide items acquired through volume purchasing such as fuel, spare parts, aircraft leasing and insurance for a reasonable transition period.\n\nPreventing excessively aggressive competition activity by a dominant airline will be a priority for our government, as will be ensuring smaller airlines reasonable access to airport facilities and services and to computer reservations systems.\n\nThe government has made it clear that in the new process the Competition Bureau will review any specific proposed merger or acquisition with regard to competition issues. The results will be taken into account by the Minister of Transport who will make a comprehensive recommendation to the governor in council.\n\nThese government initiatives regarding airline competition, in my view, are measured and reasonable to accomplish the policy objectives. Certainly they are in the best interests of Canadians wherever they live.\n\nIn closing, as stated in the government's October 26 policy framework statement, regardless of how things evolve in terms of airline industry restructuring in Canada, the government is intent on ensuring that the public interest remains paramount and is protected. The government is confident that the entrepreneurial spirit of Canada will remain strong and that competitive air services will develop and provide real options for travellers.\n\nThe government is also confident that the House and Senate standing committees will provide useful advice on the implementation of remedies for competitive issues. As well, these committees have been requested to provide their views on this issue.\n\nI believe that parliamentarians in this House should be given a chance to provide views on this important issue. I oppose the hon. member's motion to make a decision on the issue today. We need to let the process take its course. I think that is what Canadians want and it is what all of us need.",

Can we imagine calling for those kinds of cutbacks and now arguing the other side?\n\nI was reading not so long ago in the Montreal Gazette that the member for Cumberland—Colchester accused the minister of changing the ground rules to favour the Onex takeover bid. It is truly amazing that those Tories who wreaked havoc when Mulroney was in power are trying to do things today which are totally at odds with what we as a government are doing in a very effective and promising way for Canadians. Such nonsense will not be tolerated by the Canadian people.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the hon. member's motion concerning the government's policy framework for the airline restructuring in Canada announced on October 26 by the Minister of Transport.\n\nThe motion before us concerns whether the current prohibition on any person or persons holding more than 10% of Air Canada voting shares should be maintained. The government has clearly stated in its policy framework that it is prepared to consider increasing the limit to a new level after input from parliamentarians, if such a measure contributes to achieving a healthy Canadian controlled airline industry. In this context it articulated a number of key elements in its policy framework, including the desire to foster as much competition as possible in the airline industry in Canada.\n\nThis framework also clarifies the government's intention to review Canadian international air policy in a new Canadian airline environment.\n\nA revised international air policy is a critical element of the new policy framework for airline restructuring. International air services account for more than 50% of the revenues of Canada's two major airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International.\n\nThese services are even more important to Canadian's largest charter carriers: Air Transat, Canada 3000, Royal Aviation and Sky Service. These carriers operate extensive passenger charter services both domestically and throughout the world. In his policy framework announcement the minister clearly stated that the government would revise its policies for international scheduled and charter air services with a view to removing unnecessary restrictions on air services.\n\nI am sure members would all agree that such a commitment is clearly warranted now that the industry structure appears to be changing. Canada's international charter policies, for example, were developed in 1978. One of its primary objectives was to allow charter carriers to compete effectively with scheduled carriers like Air Canada and Canadian Airlines for international leisure passengers.\n\nThe objective has been implemented through regulations administered by the Canadian Transportation Agency and effected through a series of charter fences such as pre-booking and minimum stay requirements. Therefore a policy approach that protects parts of the market for scheduled services from charter competition was deemed to be in the public interest.\n\nIn an environment where Canada might be faced with one dominant Canadian scheduled carrier operating both domestic and international air services, the minister has clearly signalled that the current degree of protection for scheduled air carriers from charter service competition on international routes will be reviewed.\n\nThe minister has also indicated that the government intends to review its international scheduled air policy. This is the policy framework by which the Minister of Transport exercises his authority to assign to specific Canadian carriers the right to operate scheduled international routes to specific countries.\n\nOther than the Canada-U.S. market where any number of Canadian carriers may be designated, today's policy framework designation of international routes states that two Canadian carriers may be designated in markets exceeding 300,000 scheduled passenger trips per year.\n\nIn markets below that threshold only one Canadian carrier will be designated. This policy framework has developed over time. Historically international scheduled routes were granted to Air Canada and CP Air, later known as Canadian Airlines International. This approach was known as the division of the world approach whereby each carrier was assigned exclusive access to specific markets in order to support the broad viability of each carrier's operations.\n\nChanges have evolved to make the approach more transparent and more competitive. The current policy framework includes a use it or lose it approach whereby airlines that are granted designations must operate them at a minimum level of service or potentially lose them to another air carrier.\n\nGiven the potential changes to the airline structure in Canada, the minister has indicated a need to revise these policies with a view to removing all unnecessary restrictions on air services. This clearly is in keeping with the objective of fostering competition as articulated in the new policy framework which has formed part of the recently released recommendations of the commissioner of competition in his letter to the minister.\n\nThe government has stated its intention to reconsider its approach to the 60 plus bilateral air agreements the government has negotiated with other countries. We will determine the extent to which Canadian and foreign carriers should have more international route opportunities. These agreements or treaties guarantee the airlines assigned by each country the right to operate specific international scheduled routes, the frequency of services permitted, the type of aircraft that may be operated, and even the number of airlines that may be authorized to operate.\n\nCanada's bilateral air agreements are varied in their degree of openness. Sometimes Canada is not able to secure at the negotiating table all the rights it may seek. In the end this can have an impact on the kinds of services that may be operated. Canada does have considerable experience with open or liberal bilateral agreements.\n\nThe Canada-U.S. open skies agreement is a case in point. Before the agreement was concluded some 82 city pairs received non-stop scheduled services. After the agreement the number of such city pairs increased to 135. Passenger traffic has increased by 8.5% a year. The Canadian charter industry has remained active and has converted many of its services from charter to regular scheduled flights. Furthermore the Canadian airline industry has increased it share of the Canadian-U.S. market from 43% in 1994 to 49% in 1997.\n\nIn the context of a restructured industry where we want to foster and enhance competition and provide opportunities for Canadian carriers to operate international scheduled services, the government's decision to review its approach to negotiating bilateral air agreements, combined with a review of its international air policies, will be timely and warranted. The government has proposed an approach that will promote a healthy and viable air transport system in Canada.",

What is transparent is the strategy used by the government to make sure one company and one company only takes over the airlines. It is very transparent.\n\nThe member stated that on October 26 the minister started a new strategy and in a new direction to see how the airline would eventually be taken over. He would make the process more competitive by perhaps abandoning the 10% rule to allow an airline or a company to own more than 10% of a Canadian airline. We must realize that by October 26 there were only 16 days left in the process. There are only 14 days left in the process now. Suddenly we are opening it up.\n\nBy some type of a miracle or coincidence Onex puts a bid in for 14.5% Canadian ownership. It is a coincidence. I understand that, but the bottom line is that if he wanted to make the process competitive, should he not have changed the 10% rule at the very beginning of the process? Probably a number of other bidders would have bid on the process at that time. However, 74 days into the process they have been cut out. They will not come in now with a new plan so what we really have to do is extend the timeframe.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can follow the same act. I suggest that this debate did not come to the floor of the House like the great historic transportation debates that took place in the past.\n\nIf we went back to Confederation and the years thereafter, the House and the committee spent months on the great transportation debate: The building of a railway across Canada, the national dream. The only thing in the last 100 years even comparable to that was a little bill called the national highway strategy program which was a piece of paper.\n\nThis is the big issue for this century. In the closing days of this century this will be the biggest transport issue since 1900 until the new millennium comes in. The most unfortunate thing is that the House first learned of everything that was going on through the papers. Most of what Canadians know about this great debate and the merger they learned through the papers.\n\nI sit on the transport committee. I have enjoyed very much talking to some very key witnesses. Canadians phone me and ask if the same rules apply to everybody. They want to know if there is a level playing field. I cannot answer those questions but I have my suppositions. However, whatever happens in this great debate that will always remain in the minds of the people.\n\nI want to congratulate my colleagues in the Bloc Party for bringing this to the floor of the House. Whether I agree with the 10% increase or not is not the issue. In the past, when we had these great transportation debates, we always brought in capital from all over the world to help us. This happened with the railway and originally with the airline industry.\n\nWhat we have here is an emergency. I did not create that emergency. None of the parties on this side of the House created the emergency. It was going on. Unfortunately, the story broke when the House was not in session.\n\nIt was not only awkward for me and other members of the committee to hear statements being made when we were in our home constituencies, but two days before we arrived here I read in the paper who the new chairman of the transport committee was going to be.\n\nI do not know if that was a charade, but we usually go through the actions of a committee meeting before making a decision as to who the chair will be. The second order of business would be to choose what topic we were going to discuss. That was pre-announced. I am not arguing about that because I think that would have happened anyway. What I am arguing about is that, unfortunately, and I am not blaming anyone, the House will never have the time, because of the urgency of this matter, to properly debate the issue.\n\nI see the minister is here. I believe he has given us a timetable of something like November 26. Our last witness in the transport committee will appear on November 24.\n\nMr. Speaker, I failed to announce that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.\n\nWhat was the immediate Canadian reaction? What are some of the questions? My phone lines have been busy with people asking if this is a fair procedure. The government will have to answer that. Is it a fair procedure?\n\nThe next question they ask is: Will it keep the regional airlines intact? Coming from the west, they have fallen in love with WestJet. We have received some assurances in committee that would take place but I would like to see that on paper.\n\nThe fundamental question is: If there is only one dominant domestic air carrier within Canada in the future, could it really be said that a monopoly exists given that there is a relative freedom of entry into the industry? I think that is a big question.\n\nProvided a carrier can obtain a licence and meet the initial financial fitness test, should financial fitness be assessed on an ongoing basis? We have used the word “dominant” to replace the word “monopoly”, with the exception of some regional carriers. I submit that we will, even if it is not a necessity, go to a dominant, monopoly carrier.\n\nI have to ask if that is really necessary at this time. I am not so concerned about where we get the money. I would suggest to my friends in the Bloc that I do not care where the money comes from for these ventures, whether it comes from Germany, France or the United States. In the history of the United States, when it developed much of its money came from Germany.\n\nAt any one time we have always had about 10% of the population of the United States. We have heard from witnesses that our major role and major profit in this industry goes south. That part does not worry me. I do not think we should have limitations. That is where I disagree with the Bloc.\n\nI wish I was in a position today to make some guarantees about the future of the airline industry in Canada. Unfortunately, we have only had but a few weeks with just a few hours left before the decision is made. Let us hope for the travelling public, those who must use the airline, that it is a good decision and that the House will in the future be notified in plenty of time to have a debate on this great issue, as it did with the railways and other great transportation issues, on the floor of the House and in no other place.",

If that will be the case, and I fully suspect it will be, I hope it will come to the House. I hope it does not take place as this issue has in the past.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. It is a very interesting motion, which affects most of us because of the employees of both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines who live in our ridings. This issue is exceedingly important to them.\n\nPart of their concern is that they want to know the truth about what is going on. Unfortunately what we have seen is a polarization amongst the employees of both companies, so much so that it is causing an extraordinary amount of acrimony.\n\nI would say, and I am sure many members would agree, that Canadian carriers, both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, have the finest staff, as well as some of the best planes in the world. Oftentimes Canadians wonder what we can do, as opposed to the rest of the world, and we need not look any further than those two carriers to see Canada excelling in the airline transport industry.\n\nHaving said that, there are things we need to do to ensure we are not left with an airline industry in disarray, which would affect the employees and especially consumers who want the assurance that whatever comes of these discussions they will be protected and not left with a monopoly and the possibility of price gouging. They want a fair and equitable decision for the employees of both airlines.\n\nLet us look at the issue put forth by the Bloc Quebecois, which concerns the 10% limitation on ownership of Air Canada. We already have a 25% foreign restriction on the ownership of a Canadian carrier. That is a good thing.\n\nIf one professes to believe in allowing the market to decide, and allowing strong competition, why should we prohibit any individual or group in this country from having greater ownership of Air Canada? What is so wrong with having a person or group own a larger share of Air Canada or Canadian Airlines, or any company for that matter?\n\nIt is not right for the government to impose those kinds of restrictions upon a private carrier. It limits and creates a barrier to that company becoming as effective as it could be.\n\nOn the issue of competition, as I am sure most people here would agree, we would like to see two carriers, competitive, healthy and profitable, being able to take on not only other groups within Canada but also around the world, and win, which they can do.\n\nThe sad state of affairs today, with both of these companies having trouble, is that we are looking toward a merger. As my colleague, our critic, has mentioned before very eloquently, rather than having a merger take place in an environment of chaos, let us do it in a relatively controlled fashion so that market forces can take place, but we can be left at the end of the day with a merger that will strengthen the airline industry in our country. I think that is what we all agree ought to happen.\n\nWe need a level playing field, so that both groups can compete or both groups can merge.\n\nThe truth must come out about what is really going on. The issue of debt levels is very important in terms of how investors look at both companies and there has been a lot of misinformation about what the debt levels are in both companies.\n\nAccording to the most recent information we have, Canadian's debt is around $1 billion and Air Canada's is around $9 billion. Many of the employees of both companies do not know that. They have been fed different lines as the political battles take place over the merger of the two companies.\n\nAs our eloquent transport critic has mentioned, we want to ensure that if we are left with a single carrier there will not be price gouging and there will be legislation in place to protect the public from it.\n\nOn the issue of service to small communities, given the nature of our country, its broad scope and sparse populations, we need access to adequate transportation facilities, in particular by air. We want to make sure that people in remote areas will be serviced properly and we will press the Minister of Transport to make sure that whatever comes of this there will be consideration in the legislation to ensure that those people living in remote areas will be protected.\n\nThe employees of Air Canada have a legitimate concern about their rights. Because they have a younger staff, if or when they merge with Canadian Airlines, they fear they will be taken over and put at the bottom of the barrel. That would not be fair and it would not be equitable.\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Airlines' workers fear that if they are to be merged with Air Canada, which has a larger number of employees, their numbers will diminish and they will lose employees, which would be equally unfortunate.\n\nWe ask the Minister of Transport to ensure that there will be fair and equitable treatment of the employees of both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines.\n\nOn the issue of the proposed legislation to review the airline merger, there are a couple of points that we would like to put before the Minister of Transport. First, we take offence to and oppose the Competition Bureau being reduced from its legislative role to an advisory role. We would also like to see the transport committee take a larger role in this and advise the minister as to how this should take place. Members of that committee should be involved. The Competition Bureau, with its rules and regulations governing competition within the country, should not be suspended for this particular merger. That is not correct. It also adds an element of partiality which I know the minister would not like to see in this particular merger, given the well known connections that he and the government have with Onex Corporation. However, that should not preclude Onex from having a fair go at being able to merge these groups.\n\nIn closing I would like to say that members on all sides of the House are very much in favour of ensuring that whatever comes out of the Air Canada-Canadian Airlines trade war, which is what it is, we will be left at the end of the day with a strong airline industry which will be profitable and able to continue to take on competition and win in the aggressive airline transportation industry.",

I will share my time with the member for Mississauga West.\n\nToday's motion reminded me of what happened in the early days of aircraft flying. I am reminded of a story told by Bishop Wright one Sunday in church when he was lecturing to the congregation. At that time there were two significant things happening. One was that there were to be blood transfusions coming out of Stanford and he thought that was not a good thing. There was no mention of it in the Bible. As well, he said “I hear that some people have developed some of these metal things that can fly”. He said “Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation, I want to tell you that flying is only reserved for angels”.\n\nThe government is here to make legislative changes, but those changes have to be what is best for Canadians. The country is large and has a northern climate. There are airports in many remote areas. Canadians would like to be able to get across this country as often as they can and as cheaply as they can. Every once in a while when it gets a little cold they want to go south. As a member of the transport committee, the question I have is what is in the best interests of the public and how can we get there? The minister has outlined five points.\n\nThe problem with the debate today is that it is being clouded by extemporaneous things. We have our own little nuances and little enclaves because we are a federation. We have to look beyond the federation to see how the system can be better while being reminded that this is a Canadian institution. None of us in the House, including members on this side, will ever give that up.\n\nWe want to have full control of the Canadian airline industry. So far we have done well. We started with Air Canada which had a lot of help from the government. The government helped Air Canada get on its feet. As always happens in this place, when Air Canada started making money the opposition did not like it and we had to privatize it. We said it was okay, that it could fly on its own.\n\nLater on we did the same thing for Canadian Airlines in a balanced approach. We gave it some international routes and allowed it some slots in British airports. It is working quite well.\n\nThe transport committee heard from the Canadian Transportation Agency. It heard from the Competition Bureau. They have a lot of resources, skills and experience. They told us that we have benefited from deregulation over the last number of years.\n\nI do not think the Minister of Transport got up one morning and decided that the industry had a problem. We ended up with this problem because of the changes in the international market, in international allegiances and alliances and because things do change in the marketplace.",

Can they have better flights and faster routing using other systems? That is what we are examining. As far as I know, every time the government has changed regulations it has been for the better.

These are corporate moves. We will be faced with having to make a decision. The minister has listened to public forums and gathered all the needed information. He asked the Competition Bureau to look at it. He asked the regulators to look at it. When this offer comes before us we want all our options open. We will make a decision and the decision will be that Canadians will still effectively have control.\n\nThe question is will there be effective control? Will small communities be serviced?

I am sure all of us recognize that flying goes beyond that.\n\nI am wondering if in any of his comments Bishop Wright talked about ethics. Did he talk about living by the rules and laws while they are in place? If that is not going to be the case, maybe the government side should take a flight to the moon and let the public interest be handled by Canadians and people who care about the public interest.\n\nI have to question a government that does not ensure that the laws are being adhered to. If a government is not doing that, how is it representing the best interests of Canadians?",

Their input costs are enormous. The price they get for their grain is depressed because of international subsidies. They battle the weather to plant and harvest their crops and when they get their grain to market, 42% of its depressed value is ripped off the top for handling and transportation.\n\nIf something is not done about these conditions, Canada is going to lose its farmers and our food producing capacity.\n\nI say to Mr. Steinwand, to his family and thousands of farmers like him, the government has failed you, it has failed your families and it has failed the country.",

Certainly the suffering of black slaves in chains is a terrible thing. I raise this point of order not only as a black MP but on behalf of the dignity of the House and all Canadians fighting racism.\n\nDisreputable and unparliamentary language has no place in the House. As we set an example for children and families throughout the country, racism can neither be overlooked or condoned, especially within the House of Commons.\n\nI call on the MP who said those words to set a positive example for our youth and for all of us. I call on the MP to have the conscience and fortitude to admit his words, withdraw his comments and set an example by apologizing to people of colour, to his colleagues in the House, and to all Canadians.\n\nFinally, through this we can move forward and use this as a example of how to fight racism in our workplace.

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the Liberal member for Mississauga West.\n\nI am speaking today in the context of the policy framework made public earlier this week by the Minister of Transport.\n\nI must thank the minister for appearing before the Standing Committee on Transport and all of its members. His vision of a Canadian airline industry that is not only safe and prosperous, but also meets the needs of Canadians in the XXI century is clear and lucid.\n\nThat vision identifies the issues requiring government action and the areas in which such action will make it possible to strengthen this industry on the eve of the new millennium.\n\nOne of the questions being debated is the possibility of amending the Air Canada Public Participation Act. Under this legislation, no individual or group of individuals may hold or control more than 10% of voting shares in Air Canada.\n\nWhen Air Canada was privatized in 1988 and the Air Canada Public Participation Act came into effect, the view at the time was that Air Canada shares should be spread over a large shareholder base. Whether that point of view is still valid in 1999 is debatable.\n\nIn his statement on his policy last Tuesday, the minister indicated that he was prepared to increase this limit, if, and only if, doing so would help achieve the objective of a prosperous airline industry under Canadian control.\n\nTo this end, the minister asked the two Standing Committees on Transport to examine the question of the 10% limit and, after consulting the main stakeholders and considering the future of the industry, to make recommendations on a possible change to this limit.\n\nAll the members of this House know that the airline industry must undergo major changes; they are inevitable. The broad policy for the restructuring of the airline industry in Canada the minister presented to us establishes guidelines for the transformation of an industry, currently comprising two main carriers, into an industry in which a dominant carrier will emerge.\n\nIn this regard, the public at large, consumer associations, independent carriers, travel agents and other stakeholders have raised serious concerns about the impact of consolidation on competition in the airline industry.\n\nIn fact, in my big region of Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, with over 36 airports, and airlines such as Air Inuit, Air Creebec, First Air, Air Boréal and Air Wemindji, First Air is the third largest regularly scheduled airline in Canada and its Inuit owned parent company, Makivik, is paying close attention to statements and actions by the various groups in the reorganization of the airline industry in Canada.\n\nThe fear is that a dominant carrier could, by design or inadvertently, act unfairly. Such action would eliminate or limit competition with the intent of controlling air traffic.\n\nIn August of this year, Canada's Minister of Transport wrote to Konrad Von Finckenstein in his capacity as Commissioner of the Competition Bureau. In particular, the minister called on the commissioner and the bureau to help the government develop a position that would take the interests of Canadians into account, while giving the private sector the necessary leeway to develop proposals for the structure of a viable industry. The bureau's response, dated October 22, was made public last Tuesday.\n\nI would like to take a few minutes to examine certain issues having to do with domestic competition that were identified by the Competition Bureau.\n\nI am referring here to the issue of predatory pricing and to the issue of airport access. The Competition Bureau notes that a dominant carrier will have both the incentive and ability to engage in various types of anti-competitive behaviour, including predation. Within the airline industry, predatory behaviour can take various forms, including predatory pricing.\n\nPredatory pricing occurs when an airline temporarily sets low fares to inflict losses on one or more rival airlines, or matches fares while adding additional capacity. Once it has eliminated the competitor, the carrier restores higher prices.\n\nThe policy framework announced by the federal Minister of Transport deals with this very issue. The document states that “Small and new entrant carriers are potentially vulnerable to excessively aggressive competitive attacks from a larger, established airline. Small carriers run the risk that a dominant carrier may try to drive them out of a market or out of business by substantially lowering fares and increasing capacity in the short run with the intention of recovering the short term losses with price increases in the long run”.\n\nInitially, consumers might seem to benefit from lower prices, but the long term result will be a narrower range of choices and higher prices.\n\nThe federal Minister of Transport stated that predatory prices will not be tolerated. According to the overall policy, the Government of Canada must ensure that effective measures are taken to deal with abuse in the air transportation industry.\n\nThe commissioner recommended that some sections of the Competition Act and its regulations be amended to grant him the authority to act in this area. Under the overall policy of the federal Minister of Transport, the government recognizes that this is a key issue which must be dealt with decisively.\n\nThe minister has asked the House and Senate committees to make recommendations on the best way to reach this goal.\n\nAlso, small or new air carriers have trouble gaining access to airports. This is a complex problem that was also examined in detail by the Competition Bureau.\n\nIn order to be competitive, new Canadian carriers must get reasonable access to departure and arrival slots as well as various airport facilities, such as boarding gates, loading bridges and ticket counters.\n\nThe federal government intends to come up with innovative ways to facilitate access to airports. I would like to elaborate on this point.\n\nA “slot” is an expected time of departure or arrival that is available or allocated to a specific airline, for a specific date, at a specific airport. Take, for example, Toronto's Pearson airport. It is the only Canadian airport that is currently operating at full capacity. It is also the airport where most new entrant carriers will want to land.\n\nA carrier created by merging Air Canada and Canadian Airlines would use up a large portion of the slots at Toronto's airport, particularly during peak hours.\n\nSince the slots are reserved for carriers as long as they need them, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for other carriers to get enough slots to establish new services.\n\nThe policy framework announced by the federal Minister of Transport deals with this specific issue. It notes that independent carriers and airport authorities have identified access to airport facilities at the large congested airports as a potential barrier to competition.\n\nWithout being able to offer services at Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto and other major airports, new entrant carriers and other small carriers will not be able to compete effectively against a dominant carrier.\n\nThe policy framework states that the dominant carrier may need to give up some of its access to congested runways so that other airlines can add to their domestic services.\n\nGuidelines or regulations to ensure fair and competitive allocation of slots may be needed at Toronto and at any other airports where slot control proves necessary.\n\nThe guidelines would ensure that a reasonable portion of the surrendered slots comes from the most congested times, days and seasons, as these slots are the hardest to obtain.\n\nIn conclusion, in a restructured industry with a dominant carrier, it will be necessary to promote competition. The government intends to put in place the necessary mechanisms to encourage the arrival of new entrant carriers and the growth of existing ones, such as First Air, Air Inuit, Air Québec, Air Canada, Air Wemindji, Canadian Airlines and others in Canada.",

Looking at what the government is doing today, I would never have believed a democratically elected government could stoop so low in its loyalty.\n\nI think transparency is being dealt a terrible blow and this government does not have notion of what justice is. This is purely and simply a dictatorship. I indicated earlier that there was unanimity within the community and the business community in particular, but the media are unanimous as well.\n\nAnyone who paid attention to the media, both print and broadcast, this morning, noted that they were hard on the government. I would like to quote two articles, because if I had to quote all those I read this morning, I could go on all afternoon, and if we had to record everything that was said on television last night and this morning, we would not get out of here tonight.\n\nThe article I will quote is from the Journal de Montréa l and is written by Michel C. Auger. It is entitled “Alas, he is a minister.” It reads: “If David Collenette were a judge, we could easily—”",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, that is how the article reads, and I asked permission to read the article, but I will refer to the Minister of Transport.\n\nI was saying:\n\nWe could easily have him disqualified for being biased in the matter of the airline merger. Unfortunately, he is a minister. For quite some time we suspected the Minister of Transport—\n\nThis is not the Bloc Quebecois speaking. That is what was written in the paper this morning.\n\n—of being biased in favour of the Onex proposal, if only because of the remarkably close ties that exist between that company, Canadian Airlines International, and the Liberal Party of Canada. Tuesday, before the transport committee of the House of Commons, the Minister of Transport provided the last piece of evidence proving that he is indeed biased with regard to this issue. He announced that the federal government was prepared to suspend—without asking for anything in return—the application of the act that prevents an individual or a company to hold more than 10% of Air Canada shares. The 10% rule is important because it is the only legal obstacle to the Onex proposal, which is the only proposal that requires such a change. Such a rule limiting concentration of ownership was included, mind you, in practically all transactions to privatize Crown corporations over the last few years. While in the public interest, this limitation will be waived by the government in support of a proposal made by a private company. Most importantly, it was the only lever available to the federal government to have a direct influence on this transaction, which will determine to a large extent the future of air transportation in Canada. It is a rather unique situation. Onex made a proposal that could not even be considered without an amendment to an act of parliament. Practically at the first opportunity, the government announced that it would agree to this request and not ask anything in return.\n\nThe article goes on:\n\nThis is what the transport minister means by “parliamentary consultation”. It is a kind of consultation that is completely meaningless because it comes after the fact, after the vote on Onex's offer by Air Canada's shareholders. We might as well say that the transport minister works for Onex.\n\nI did not say it, it is in today's paper. The article goes on:\n\nOf course, if we do not allow the government to modify the 10% rule, Onex's offer will die.\n\nIt is quite clear.\n\nWe could always believe that the government does not want Air Canada to win by default. However, there must be an amendment to an act of parliament to make Onex's offer legal. That must be justified by saying that the Canadian public will gain something from it. Better guarantees for air service in remote areas could have been required.\n\nFor example, in my riding, on the north shore, the distance between Ottawa and Sept-Îles is 1,200 kilometres. And the price of tickets is very high. A trip from Ottawa to Sept-Îles costs more than $1,000.\n\nThe article goes on:\n\nDo you know of many corporations that have got, with nothing in return, such favours from a government, when their bids were contrary to the law and could not have been made to the interested shareholders? But the Minister of Transport had nothing to ask for in return. We might as well say right away the minister works for Onex. Meanwhile, it has to be noted that this same government and this same minister did not lift a finger to help Air Canada, the more profitable of the two corporations, but the one that is unfortunate enough not to have friends in high places among the friends and the bagmen of the Liberal Party of Canada. What is even more ironic is when the minister states that once the airlines merger is completed, the government intends to be very watchful of the new monopoly, that it intends to protect the rights of consumers and the rights of official language minorities and that it will deal severely with any attempt to inflate prices. In short, the government intends to watch closely the new monopoly, but it claims that it has no role to play in the creation of the new monopoly and that it is letting market forces determine everything. As long, of course, as the market sees to it that the friends of the government end up the winners.\n\nI really wanted to quote this article. I think I will only skim over the other one. I will not read from it, but comment on it. I will defend the position of the Bloc Quebecois.\n\nIn this morning's issue of Le Droit , we see that on air transportation “The Liberals do not agree with each other”.\n\nBut where are the Liberals? During the last campaign, a Liberal delegation came in my riding and told us not to stay behind the boards, but jump on to the ice instead. Where are the Liberal members for Quebec now, when they should be jumping in and exposing the unfairness of this government? We know for a fact that, in this government, only one vote counts, the Prime Minister's vote. If he votes yea, all Liberal members vote the same way. If the votes nay, they all say nay.\n\nThey do have a spokesperson. But the parrots all keep repeating what their boss says. They have marching orders. That is how the government views democracy. Did members ever see the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges stand up for Quebecers in the House and disagree with the government? Where is he? He keeps repeating the same old story and he tries to come up with a defence for the transport minister.",

I did not have the time to read the press clippings this morning.\n\nYesterday, the minister told the transport committee “Safety remains Transport Canada's top priority”.\n\nIt takes some nerve on the part of an MP or a minister to say such things. How can the minister explain that, in Quebec's north shore and Gaspé region, we have had three plane crashes in eight months.\n\nA Mira Aviation plane crashed on landing in Gaspé.A Nordair plane crashed in Sept-Îles, in the riding of Manicouagan. People were injured and the passengers had to call for help, because no one had seen the crash. Finally, an Air Satellite plane crashed in Baie-Comeau on December 7. That accident was witnessed by a six-year old girl, from her parents' residence.\n\nWhen the federal government delegated to Nav Canada responsibility for transport safety, Nav Canada made cuts at the expense of passenger safety. It reduced the number of air traffic controllers, shut down control towers, and eliminated firefighting services at airports. Now, the federal government wants to privatize those airports, which already are not viable.\n\nMy questions to the hon. member for Manicouagan are as follows. Does he think that, in the region of Manicouagan and particularly in Sept-Îles—which is currently served by two airlines, namely Air Alliance and Canadian Airlines—the airport will be more viable? Will there be better customer service? Will travel agencies in his riding gain anything? They create jobs in his riding and provide ticket, reservation and checking services. The number of passengers will increase. Since 1996, travel agencies have been losing money. Yet, they create jobs. Could the hon. member tell me about his concern regarding current versus future airline services in Sept-Îles, which is the largest city of his riding of Manicouagan?",

His question gives me the opportunity to tell the House about a scandal that occurred at the Sept-Îles airport.\n\nMoney is not spent on enhancing security in the transportation industry, as the hon. member for Charlevoix pointed out. When I was city councillor, we were told that the airport was being transferred to us.\n\nI was against the project, because the airport, which was located in my ward, came with an annual deficit of $2 million, $2.2 million to be exact. However, the city council met and I was there when we were told “Give us five minutes and we will explain how you can get rid of the $2 million deficit”. I said “You have been running a $2 million deficit every year for 30 years now. That is $60 million. Why were these measures not taken before today?”\n\nThey started by saying “We have a firefighting service with trucks and 9 firefighters that we pay for year round and have never been put to task. Besides, if there were a fire, there would not be enough pressure, as there is not enough water. We have a pumper, but it is not powerful enough. We have to get help from the Sept-Îles firefighters. There were two fires and both times the firefighters from the city of Sept-Îles were called to do the work. So we will get rid of the firefighting service and save almost a million dollars”.\n\nWe were told that there were three airstrips and only one was in use. It is 1,000 feet longer that the average strip and 50 feet wider. It can handle a departure and a landing every ten minutes. We could save $800,000.\n\nThere was a restaurant that took up a whole floor and cost $300,000 in heating bills. We were told it could be moved downstairs, that service would be better and the savings would be $200,000.\n\nSo, they reduced the deficit and there will even be a small surplus this year. This goes to show how the money was utterly wasted at Sept-Îles airport. However, security services are being cut, even though we have had fatal accidents.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, we are debating today a motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois asking the House of Commons to reaffirm its desire to maintain a provision of the act limiting the ownership by any company or person to 10 per cent of the voting shares of a corporation, especially in the case at hand of the eventual purchase of Air Canada by Onex.\n\nVery seldom do we see a government intervene in a battle for control between private sector corporations by loading the dices as it has done in the present case.\n\nNobody will succeed in convincing us today that the government was not in league with Onex from the beginning.\n\nLet us look at each stage of the process leading to the present situation—Onex' last offer was made only an hour and a half ago—and see how the actions of Onex and the government add up to what the member for Roberval described during today's Oral Question Period as “the crater we are inexorably headed for, which is the acceptance of the Onex project”.\n\nIncidentally, Onex is the company which will take control, and which has a particular interest in this acquisition. One wonders about its long term intentions for the companies that it is trying to buy, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada.\n\nIt is very strange to note that, on the subject of these two firms, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, the one in the greater financial difficulty today is Canadian Airlines.\n\nIf no changes are made at this point, Canadian Airlines' ability to carry on business in the coming quarters is very limited. It will probably have major problems—and this will not be the first time, because it has already had them—and, surprisingly, on a number of occasions, this very government, the federal government has come to its aid. Whether by providing foreign routes, or by providing funding when American Airlines arrived on the scene the first time, the federal government has always helped to bail out Canadian Airlines.\n\nThis time, however, it is becoming a bit too indecent to artificially support the company. Accordingly, a new player has arrived—Onex—which intends to join Canadian, with American Airlines behind the scenes, to take control of Air Canada.\n\nAir Canada is the more profitable of the two companies, is the only potentially profitable one of the two and is being taken over by the other because of this intervention.\n\nEven if last minute information gives the impression of a certain number of parameters being changed, it is not in fact the case when we look at the long term, the change to the rule of 10% is not insignificant in what is going on. It serves to give the advantage to the player or the hand holding the strings behind Canadian and behind Onex—American Airlines.\n\nThe minister is making fine speeches about “allowing the shareholders to speak, and when a definitive scenario has been decided upon—”, that is what the government is saying, “when it is all over, we are going to look after the interests of consumers and everyone else.” The government is setting out broad principles.\n\nAt one point, this government suspended part of the Competition Act and decided or announced that the 10% limit would be changed. All of a sudden and as if by chance, the very week of the deadline—the companies wishing to make a take-over have until midnight tonight—the minister announced his intention to review the 10% rule and demonstrate a very open mind.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the people from Onex, who seem to have a great familiarity with the people in the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport, who are great pals, were not kept informed of the government's intentions.\n\nOf course that would be very hard to prove, but the actions, the outcome and the progress of this matter demonstrate very clearly that there is a very close collaboration between certain people in government—those with influence and decision makers, anyway—and the people from Onex.\n\nWhere will all this take us? It will lead to a situation where the strongest of the two companies will find itself in a weaker position. In this case, Quebec, where Air Canada is well established, will suffer more job losses because of the federal government's involvement.\n\nThis also makes us wonder about a number of other issues in terms of the future, if the airline industry were to become predominantly influenced and controlled by a foreign company such as American Airlines, for example.\n\nI am convinced that air transportation in the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region is not a top priority for American Airlines. What will happen to our regions?\n\nWe Bloc Quebecois members represent the regions of Quebec. I want to clarify something. Here in Ottawa, people talk about Quebec as if it were a single region. But the regions of Quebec include the North Shore, Lower St. Lawrence, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Abitibi—Témiscamingue regions. When we talk about regional air transportation, we are not referring to Montreal-Toronto, but to air transportation to and from our regional centres.\n\nWe are very concerned. Earlier, my colleagues mentioned that airports had been taken over by the communities. If passenger and freight volumes go down, it will change the cost-effectiveness figures for the organizations that manage air traffic.\n\nThere are many things to consider. I am not even talking about airfares, which have already increased drastically since deregulation, with the result that it is now very difficult for people living in regions to travel at an affordable price. A traveller who did not plan his or her trip between Rouyn and Montreal well ahead of time to take advantage of a major rebate is looking at a round trip fare of more than $600.\n\nBy contrast, those flying out of Montreal or Toronto can travel quite far for the same $600. There is something indecent about this, particularly when you think that, because of the specializing that is taking place in the health sector, patients travel by plane wherever they can get treatment, which generates huge costs.\n\nRegional development probably does not mean a lot to members opposite. It makes me laugh when I hear the Liberal member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik congratulate and thank the Minister of Transport for his work. He made this statement in a meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport.\n\nI have no congratulations for the minister, far from it, and particularly not with regard to this issue. This same minister who closed the military college in Saint-Jean—let us not forget that—is now working to ensure that Quebec will come out a loser in this biased process in which the federal government has a hand.\n\nThere is obviously some disagreement within the government on this matter, and it is perhaps worth pointing out. There are some interesting quotations. In the October 26 edition of Le Devoir , Marc Lalonde, who is cut from the same cloth as the members opposite, had this to say:\n\nIt is odd that a public bid for a hostile takeover of the country's major air carrier should be launched on the assumption that the existing legislation will be changed to allow that takeover to occur. In all my years in the public sector, I have never seen a more disturbing challenge to the rights of parliamentarians.\n\nGod knows, Mr. Lalonde has been around for a long time. So this is one of their friends speaking, not a nasty separatist from Quebec. He says that the process has been biased from the start, because one of the players has the advantage of privileged information.\n\nAs for the fact that it will be possible to amend legislation, if necessary, what message does this send for other private transactions? The message it sends is this: “Stay on the good side of the members opposite and, if you are having trouble with a particular issue, worry not because we will take care of the legislation in due course, depending on our interests, the party coffers, and 56 other variables”.\n\nThere are members from Quebec in this government and others elsewhere who can also see through this transaction, and I am certain that the lobby was limited to a few government insiders. The policy must be changed, and the government must not agree to change the rules of the game mid-stream to the advantage of one player and one carrier.",

Aware of the urgency of the situation, today the Bloc Quebecois moved an opposition motion with a view to informing Canadians of what an airline merger will mean for them.\n\nAfter putting questions to Air Canada officials, the minister, officials from the competition bureau, and Canadian Airlines yesterday, the committee will have the opportunity to hear from Onex next week.\n\nFrom what Air Canada and Canadian Airlines were able to tell us in response to our questions, we have learned that Canadian Airlines has been talking to the transport minister since January 1999.\n\nWe are going through turbulent times. The air transport industry is going through a storm. The minister took it upon himself to amend section 47, essentially telling the competition bureau: “This is none of your business, I am using section 47 to give the airlines 90 days to prepare their bid and come to an agreement.”\n\nWhy did the minister not ask Canadian Airlines and Air Canada to sit at the table as early as January? Why did he not ask both major Canadian carriers to sit down together? Instead, he waited and opened up section 47 at the request of Onex. Then Onex tabled its bid. Air Canada made another bid. Onex had no choice but to make a higher offer. The decision will be up to the shareholders, those who own shares in Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. They will accept the best proposal with no regard for which offers the better service.\n\nThey will not look to see whether Rouyn-Noranda, Témiscamingue, the north shore, Manicouagan, or Gaspé have improved service. They will look to see which is the better deal. Shareholders will decide, not parliamentarians, and they will do it according to the proposals put before them.\n\nThe minister made promises to Onex. Onex said “I have a problem. If I become the major manager, if I put in a lot of money, I am taking a risk with the 10% rule”. So the minister replied “Well, we will increase it, we will change the Competition Act”.\n\nCould the hon. member for Témiscamingue tell me why the 10% rule should be changed in this case, when it was not changed for Petro Canada? The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was prevented from investing in CP Rail, and was told: “No, it is 10%”. The federal government said, about the bank mergers, “No, it is 10%”.\n\nIn this case, the Minister of Transport is saying “Onex will serve American interests, I will not have to subsidize anymore, to prop up an air carrier. It makes no difference if 10,000 jobs are lost. It does not bother me. You deal with the problem. Tell us what you need to buy both airlines. As for section 47, it is a done deed. We will amend the Competition Act. And as for the 10%, we will increase it to 25%”.\n\nWhy is the minister prepared to do so in this case, when it was not allowed in other cases?",

The government is far more sensitive to political affinities than to regional economic development, particularly in Quebec.\n\nI am happy my colleague raised this issue. In the past, this section was used to prevent Quebec portfolios from acquiring too many shares. In Quebec, we have a number of development tools such as the General Investment Corporation, the Caisse de dépôt et placement, the Fonds de solidarité, major players that can become significant shareholders in various projects. The federal government did not like the 10% rule in some cases. Sometimes it suited the government, sometimes it did not, but we will have to see the consequences this will have in the future.\n\nHow will it be possible now to justify this in the other sectors still subject to this rule? If the government wanted a debate on whether the 10% rule is important or not, we could have had that debate outside the context of the Onex, Air Canada and Canadian transaction.\n\nBut the government now wants to change the rules in mid-game, in a specific case, to favour one player in particular. This is totally unacceptable. That is why the House must support the motion to reaffirm that the rules will not be changed.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I will be delighted to share my time with my hon. colleague and good friend from Mississauga Centre.\n\nI was interested to hear the debate, particularly from the Bloc members when they talked about the various issues surrounding the 10%. What I have not heard them talk about, and I am a little puzzled by this, is the real motivation behind them putting this issue before the House.\n\nBefore I talk about that I want to thank them for bringing this forward. Frankly, I think it is a good opportunity for many of us. I have many, many employees of Air Canada and some of Canadian Airlines living in my riding who have been calling me. This gives me an opportunity to put my views on the record and discuss the issue here in parliament.\n\nMembers opposite say that there is no debate. What are we doing today? Everyone is being given an opportunity to express their views. In fact, what the Bloc has done is exactly what the Minister of Transport asked parliamentarians to do; to give their views to him, to give our best advice to him, and obviously to reflect the feelings and opinions of our constituents so that he indeed can deal with a number of the issues involving this potential merger.\n\nThe minister has not changed the rules. For members opposite to say so is nothing more than misleading. Maybe it is intentional, perhaps to get around the real underlying issue.\n\nI suggest that the problem the Bloc has, which I think I understand, is that the head office of Air Canada is in the great city of Montreal. We all know that in recent history there have been dozens of major corporations move out of the city of Montreal, which I think is a tragedy. Why have they done so? They have done so because of policies put in place by the current provincial government, and other provincial governments before it, led by separatists. They have done so because of the separatist policies of the Bloc. They cannot do business with the uncertainty that exists in the province of Quebec. I think that is a shame.\n\nIn fact, one member opposite made a remark that Bloc members are working hard at committee and that they participate in debate in the House. Let me tell the House that he is right. I have been quite impressed with the number of members of the Bloc who have come to the citizenship and immigration committee and to the public accounts committee to make good quality contributions to the committee and to the democratic process. It is because they do not discuss the issue of separation. The one flame that continues to burn in the heart of that party is to separate the province of Quebec from the rest of Canada. We know that.\n\nIf we could leave that issue aside and take it out of the body politic of the Bloc, we would find some very decent, hard-working men and women who can contribute to this place. However, as long as that is there, I submit that it clouds virtually every issue which they address. It also leads to hidden agendas, which is, frankly, what we are seeing here today.\n\nHaving said that, I believe the Bloc has done us a favour in at least bringing it forward. The Bloc members know the government is not going to support them but that does not matter. What matters is that as parliamentarians we have the opportunity to stand here and to tell our constituents exactly what is going on. If we simply want to read the newspapers, as the hon. member earlier did, we can get any kind of distorted view we wish to and we can put it forward as having some sort of credibility.\n\nIf the minister had changed the rule unilaterally without discussion in this place, I too would be upset. That is not what he has done. I sat at the committee meeting. I am not a member of the transport committee but I wanted to hear firsthand what the minister's plan was. He said that he wanted our views, that he wanted some consultation, that he wanted to hear from members of all parties in the House of Commons. Imagine opposition members complaining about that. It is really quite remarkable. They must get up in the morning and ask “What has the government done that we can twist and turn around so we can oppose it?”\n\nI want to give some credit to a couple of members and they might go into apoplectic shock. I heard speeches earlier today from two members of the Reform Party, the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. Both gentlemen gave thoughtful, reasoned, intelligent remarks, something I am not used to hearing from the Reform Party. I was quite amazed. I will give credit where credit is due.\n\nHowever, the comments do not seem to match other comments made by the leader of the Reform Party at a fundraiser in Calgary. Let me share those with the House because they are somewhat confusing and somewhat contradictory to the remarks made by the two members I just referred to.\n\nThe leader of the Reform Party said: “We want to wait until all the final offers are on the table. Our aim is to get the best deal for the air travelling public”. I would have thought the Minister of Transport had said that. I would not have thought the Leader of the Opposition actually came up with something that seems to be a rational policy. He said: “Whichever deal is accepted we want a free enterprise market to deal with this. That could involve the government encouraging greater foreign and regional competition”. What does he mean?\n\nI would suggest that he wants the skies of Canada to be opened up to the extent that foreign airlines, be it American, be it United, be it whatever, can come into Canada and transport passengers between Winnipeg and Toronto, between Montreal and Vancouver, while ignoring all of the very difficult routes. They would simply cherry pick the best routes so those foreign carriers can make a profit on the best, easiest, most economical and efficient routes in Canada. They would be sucking the lifeblood out of whatever airline becomes the dominant Canadian airline. Let me stress clearly that is what is going to happen in my view.\n\nWhether the shareholders vote to accept either the Onex deal that is on the table now or some other deal that is put forward, and I guess it has to happen soon, or whether they decide to accept the offer put on the table for Air Canada, there are pros and cons to both sides of those issues. But in my view there will only be one major airline by this time next year. It will be running the major routes in this country.\n\nAre we going to do what the Leader of the Opposition has suggested and allow foreign airlines to come in and destroy that company? That could happen.\n\nThe minister has stood in his place and has said he will not change the foreign content issue. Foreign ownership of Air Canada will not increase beyond 25%. He has said that.\n\nI could not believe it so I had to verify it in Hansard but I heard the Reform Party critic ask the minister why he would not even consider allowing foreign ownership content to increase to 49%.\n\nJust as there is a hidden agenda by the Bloc, members of the Reform Party seem to be driven and motivated by a need to Americanize this country. They do it all the time. They stand and say “Do it the way they do it in the United States. They do it better”. They confuse issues.\n\nThe minister is consulting. He wants to hear the views of all parliamentarians and all Canadians. I have great confidence that he will make the right decision.",

I do not apologize for a single thing I said in this or any other speech in regard to that.\n\nLet me answer the question. The member talks about servicing small communities. I can tell him that my province of Ontario has many small communities as he would well know, as does the province of Quebec. I can tell him that the government is concerned that those communities continue to be serviced by air.\n\nThe airline industry is part of nation building. We cannot leave the people of Nunavut without that kind of service. We cannot leave northern Quebec and remote regions in Labrador or western Canada without some kind of access to affordable quality service. The minister has laid that out in his program which he presented to the committee. Pricing is absolutely a concern. Service to small communities is a concern. Jobs are a concern, not only for Air Canada employees, but for Canadian employees.\n\nI believe that through debate in parliament, through discussion in committee, through submissions that will be made by many people who will be appearing before the transport committee, all of those issues need to be addressed. I agree with the member that they are extremely important. The government is committed to that.\n\nAbove all, the government is committed to ensuring that we continue to have one of the finest, safest airline industries in the world, which we do. We have terrific people who work in them and we have two quality airlines. We just have one that is in serious financial trouble and that issue must be addressed.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to share my time with my colleague the member for Mississauga West.\n\nI rise to speak against the motion raised by the Bloc today. In his policy framework for airline restructuring in Canada, the Minister of Transport indicated on October 26 that the government was prepared to consider increasing the 10% limit to a new level to be decided following input from parliamentarians, only if such a measure contributes to a healthy Canadian airline industry.\n\nThe importance of a healthy airline industry in Canada cannot be overstated. Canada's airlines provide employment to thousands of skilled workers and are important contributors to our economy. In a country as large as Canada, they help support the very fabric of our society by connecting communities separated by hundreds, sometimes thousands, of kilometres.\n\nAs international trade and travel increase, our airlines provide Canada with critical links to the rest of the world. Canada needs a healthy airline industry to continue to enjoy these benefits and to create even greater benefits.\n\nAs my hon. colleagues are aware, the government has been very closely monitoring developments in the industry. It has assessed the implications of a major restructuring in order to form its policy framework.\n\nThe Government of Canada is committed to protecting the public interest in issues such as pricing, service to small communities and the rights and concerns of airline employees. I and my caucus colleagues have been made intimately, sometimes forcefully, aware of the concerns of the employees of both Canadian Airlines and Air Canada.\n\nAs the member of parliament for Mississauga Centre, I represent a riding that is home to hundreds, sometimes it feels like thousands, of airline employees. It is the employees of both airlines as well as the Canadian traveller that I remain most concerned about.\n\nTravellers are justifiably concerned about airfares. Competition encourages lower airfares and increases the affordability of air travel. Currently almost 90% of air travel within Canada is on discounted fares. Seat sales allow families in Vancouver to visit relatives in Montreal. They allow small business people on restricted budgets to travel more easily. They encourage tourism.\n\nIt is reasonable to be concerned that a major restructuring of the Canadian airline industry could lead to higher airfares for all consumers. The government is very much aware of these concerns and the importance of affordable air travel to all Canadians.\n\nAs stated in the policy framework for airline restructuring in Canada, clearly the best way to promote affordable air travel is to have an air industry that remains healthy as well as competitive. It is competition rather than government intervention that will be most effective in moderating airfares in the long run. However, we must consider that competition may not exert sufficient control on prices in all circumstances. It is for this reason that competition concerns have been addressed at such length by our government.\n\nThe government already has tools at its disposal to address pricing concerns, including section 66 of the Canada Transportation Act which allows the Canadian Transportation Agency to act on complaints regarding basic fares on monopoly routes. As the Minister of Transport has stated, the government will go further and assess whether these provisions should be broadened to address market dominance.\n\nAs well, the government will require commitments on pricing from the dominant carrier during any restructuring process. The government will consider adding relevant conditions to its approval of any restructuring. The government will not tolerate any price gouging of Canadian consumers.\n\nThe importance of air travel to small communities is also a very serious concern. Our airlines help support the fabric of our nation by providing crucial air service to hundreds of domestic destinations, many of them accessible only by air.\n\nSmall communities rely on air services often more than large communities. Airlines provide links to larger markets, help attract investments and provide an indispensable lifeline to the rest of Canada.\n\nAs my hon. colleagues can appreciate, a major restructuring of the airline industry could lead to a rationalization of some air services. In this regard the public, consumer representatives and northern residents have expressed their concern that air services to smaller communities could decrease or even disappear. As set out in the government's policy framework, the key to addressing this issue is to ensure that barriers to entry and to growth in the market of small regional airlines are reduced to the greatest extent possible and that there are protections from possible predatory behaviour on the part of a dominant carrier.\n\nHistory has demonstrated that where there is a demand there will be entrepreneurs willing to provide service, even in small markets. There must be an environment that will allow competition to exist. With this in mind our government has indicated that it will work to ensure that the necessary conditions for attracting competition are in place.\n\nI would like my hon. colleagues to note that the Canada Transportation Act already requires the last and second last carrier serving any community to give notice of their intention to stop service so that there will be adequate lead time for any other carrier to prepare to offer replacement service. These sections will be reviewed to determine if they remain adequate.\n\nIn addition, the government has stated that it will require commitments on service to small communities from the dominant carrier during the restructuring process and will consider adding more conditions before restructuring is approved.\n\nLastly, I would like to address concerns regarding employment. The Canadian airline industry employs thousands of skilled workers directly and indirectly. These employees have worked diligently. Many of them have made significant sacrifices to ensure the success of their companies. They have endured economic downturns and have witnessed corporate downsizing. They have agreed to pay freezes and to pay cuts. They are important contributors to the Canadian economy. I believe they merit the consideration of our government in any airline restructuring.\n\nThe government has already consulted various groups on the issue. Labour leaders have expressed the concern that employment levels may be substantially affected by a restructuring of the airline industry. They want to ensure that job impacts and dislocations are minimized and that any employment adjustments are handled exclusively through normal retirement, attrition and voluntary separation packages.\n\nAirline employees are very concerned that airline consolidation will cost them their jobs. They fear forced relocation and layoffs. It is for this reason that the government will insist that employees be treated fairly and will require commitments from a dominant carrier to this effect. The government will encourage labour management discussions with a view to reaching an agreement which is satisfactory to all.\n\nThe government believes that Canadian consumers want and deserve the benefits of competition, that small communities require air service and that airline employees deserve to be treated fairly. At the same time the government believes that these objectives are consistent with a healthy, Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nIf my hon. colleagues believe that these are laudable goals, then they should agree that we must be prepared to take the necessary steps to manage a major restructuring of the Canadian airline industry. I call on my hon. colleagues to support the government initiatives presented by the Minister of Transport on October 26, including a provision for the government to consider increasing the 10% limit on individual ownership of Air Canada's voting shares.\n\nThe Minister of Transport has been very clear on his willingness to consider a legislative change right from the beginning. One has to look no further than the minister's news release of August 13, 1999, in which he said:\n\nThe Government of Canada will also consider what further action might be required, including the possibility of introducing legislation to facilitate the implementation of an acceptable proposal and making any necessary changes to the policy and regulatory framework governing airlines.\n\nClearly the government has stated its openness to legislative change from the day the use of section 47 was announced, which was August 13.\n\nThis issue will only be decided following input from parliamentarians and then only if such a measure contributes to achieving a healthy, Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nI will repeat this for the sake of all here. The government has stated that a change to the 10% limit will only be considered if it will contribute to achieving a healthy, Canadian controlled airline industry.\n\nTo make a decision prior to proper consultation, as is effectively proposed by the hon. member's motion, would not only deprive the government of the benefits of the advice of the parliamentary standing committees, it would also be unfair to the proponents of the private sector proposals that are seen to be addressed by shareholders.\n\nFor this reason, I oppose the motion. I also appreciate, as my colleague did, the opportunity to state my position in the House. Perhaps it will relieve me of the millions of phone calls I have been getting.",

Now its lifeblood is being pumped through the airlines. The heart of the country and its regions are being fed through the airlines.\n\nIt would be a gross miscarriage of justice if we lost some control over Canadian ownership and some control over the direction this new mega airline will go in. It would be a very sad situation if we, as parliamentarians, stood back and let the market forces take over. We have to understand that some of us really believe this will keep the country together. It is important to control it to a certain extent and to monitor it so that it is the best airline it can be and one which will continue to make Canada proud.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am happy to be splitting my time with the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.\n\nI am pleased to speak to the question surrounding the airline industry. It concerns many people in my riding of Dartmouth and they are looking to Ottawa for leadership on this issue.\n\nIt is also a symbolic issue for Nova Scotia and Canada, a debate which shows how the Liberal Party has moved from being a proactive force in Canadian politics to being a caretaker government which equates the corporate good with the public good. It clearly shows how out of touch members opposite have become with the reality of most Canadians.\n\nMy constituents have approached me on the issue of the travel industry. It is an industry which employs many people in Dartmouth. They fear for their jobs. We have heard about the more than 25,000 direct jobs involved in Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, but I have also heard from people who make a living selling seat sales. They worry that they will have no jobs when there are no regional carriers, no national competition and no more seat sales.\n\nA retired Air Canada worker was in my office yesterday. He is concerned about the future of his pension. He is not a direct employee, but he is scared because this process may threaten his income. Many direct employees, be they pilots, mechanics or flight attendants, have told me or my staff that they will be forced to move to keep their jobs due to the restructuring. These people are being brave, but they are worried. Consumers in Dartmouth are also worried.\n\nAtlantic Canada has a sad history of watching our young people go down the road. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that most families in my riding have a close family member in central or western Canada. I also know that many people have moved to Dartmouth from Cape Breton, rural Newfoundland or from the Acadie to find work. Most of these peoples' families are still down home. A major force which helps to connect these families are airplanes.\n\nDue to the former Conservative policies there is no real train service left for most people in the maritimes. The Trans-Canada highway system has been abandoned by the government and motorists now face tolls throughout my region, so that option is becoming less and less a factor as well.\n\nWhat I hear people talking about over their coffee in the shop next door to my constituency office is the next seat sale to Calgary, Sydney or Gander. I am also amazed by the anger people express over the fact that it seems to cost more to fly from Halifax to St. John's than it does to fly from Toronto to London, England.\n\nPeople do not talk about the relative merits of the Onex or Air Canada offers. They are not concerned about the share price. They want to be able to see their kids. They want to know they can fly to see their parents and be by their side in an emergency.\n\nThese anxieties should have been addressed by the government. It had the opportunity. The government started the ball rolling by invoking section 47 in the summertime, but there were no assurances from the minister for Dartmouth consumers. A throne speech was delivered, but again silence on this issue. There was nothing for maritimers.\n\nThe minister did say at one point that this was a matter for the private sector, a position I believe he still stands by. He has mumbled vague words about price protection, but nothing specific. This week the minister has given assurances that the company will be accommodated and that the 10% ownership rule could be changed, but no such specifics to protect consumers.\n\nThe minister will do nothing to protect consumers because he is part of a party and a government which does not believe there is a role for government in the marketplace to protect consumers. He is protecting the choices of shareholders, not stakeholders and not the public.\n\nIt is sad that we have come to this. Canada was not built this way and Canadians have never wanted it to be this way.\n\nHalifax harbour has had a proud and vital part in the development of my country and our community.\n\nWe should always remember that its piers, its rail links and equipment did not arrive with this pretty setting. It was largely built by public money. In large part, Canada was created based on promises of a public investment in a cross-Canada rail link.\n\nOur airline industry was also built by public money. These investments were visionary in their recognition that accessible transportation links in Canada are not a frill but a necessity.\n\nThe policy allowed for the concept of the Canadian government acting for the public good. This tradition was gutted by the Conservative government in the last decade and it has been continued by the current Liberal regime.\n\nIt is sad that the Liberal government has lost that vision of the public good. It seems that at every turn on questions of trade, culture, the environment, health protection and transportation, the government feels that the corporate good outweighs the public good. The government has said that after shareholders have finished carving up the current air carriers it will bring in a law to allow the carve up. For the rest of us, the government has said “trust us”.\n\nI still remember the Liberals saying “trust us” for a national child care program, and the Liberals committing themselves to scrap the GST. I cannot trust them in any good conscience but I can call on them to remember the concept of public good in transport policy and do the following before bringing in any new law: Protect the maximum number of jobs and ensure that any job loss be offset through attrition and incentive packages; put in place a regulatory framework to guarantee fair prices and equal service to the consumer; explore all policy instruments at its disposal, which might include an equity partnership, to ensure that the public good is protected in a restructured airline industry; have all affected stakeholders participate in any eventual decision about the future of our air transport industry prior to it being taken; and, keep foreign investors in a small minority interest and do not allow them to obtain a controlling position in the affairs of Canada's national airlines.\n\nThis is our national tradition. That is what I believe constituents want to see.",

Or it is the case of Maple Leaf sausages, the more we eat, the more we like it, and the more we like it, the more we eat. We live with that.\n\nI would like to put my question by citing an example. There are two sorts of travelers. There are those obliged to travel and those travelling on holiday.\n\nThe first type of traveller may be a business person who must get from point A to point B, for example from Baie-Comeau to Montreal. That person must be in both places on the same day, then come back the next morning to be at work. Another example is a person who leaves Baie-Comeau for treatment in Quebec City or in Montreal, and who comes back the same day or the next day. The return trip between Baie-Comeau and Montreal for such a traveller not leaving the country costs $900.\n\nIf a person travels from Baie-Comeau to Montreal on his or her way to Paris or Florida, or anywhere outside the country, for a holiday, it will cost that person $285. Where is the problem? The problem is that people in the regions pay for the air miles that frequent flyers collect. Some airlines give air miles and access to the V.I.P. lounge, but the person who must travel on business, or for treatment, helps pay these promotions from major airlines.\n\nThat should be abolished. I said earlier that we should help the regional carriers that bring passengers to hubs and to interprovincial or international carriers, so as to have lower airfares.\n\nAfter talking to people from the chamber of commerce—and all chambers of commerce make representations at that level—one realizes that they are penalized, in terms of the airfare, because they leave from a region to go to a major centre. They are told that this is because the aircraft is half empty, or half full if one is an optimist. But the problem is that it is not profitable.\n\nWhy? Because it is costly. Let us eliminate the gadgets and the promotional items and let us provide competitive prices for the regions. In order to do that, the Minister of Transport must promote regional development in the context of the air transportation industry. I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on this.",

I am surprised that some of my Liberal friends are not supporting it as well.\n\nI remember, for example, my hon. friend from Prince Edward Island, when he used to be a progressive left-wing Liberal, would get up and make all kinds of speeches about Canadian nationalism and how we had to look after our own country and stand up for Canada.

We will then see who is going to be listening, myself or the hon. member from P.E.I.\n\nWhen Air Canada was privatized, parliament in its wisdom, and I think it made the wrong decision to privatize in the first place, decided that no entity could own more than 10% of Air Canada and that a maximum of 25% of it could be owned by foreigners. We were paralleling the Bank Act in many ways where nobody could own more than 10% of a bank and no more than 25% of a bank could be owned by non-Canadian entities, institutions, pension funds, et cetera. That is what happened.\n\nNow the Liberal Party is considering increasing the 10% rule. I wonder why. It think it is doing that because the Minister of Transport is favouring the proposition put forward by Mr. Gerald Schwartz who is the president of Onex.\n\nIt is interesting to talk about Mr. Schwartz. Mr. Schwartz is one of the most effective fundraisers in the Liberal Party anywhere in the country, contributing and raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Liberal Party and for candidates in that party, in particular in the province of Ontario. I think this is part of what the debate is about. If it was not about that why would the government want to change the 10% rule? Why does the government not say to Mr. Schwartz or anyone else, “If you want to make a proposal, do it in the context of existing law”.\n\nAs my friend in the Reform Party says, it is like changing the rules in the middle of a game. That is what the Liberal Party wants to do. I am surprised at the hole that the Minister of Transport and the Prime Minister have on the backbenches. Some of these people will not rise in their place and say, “All this motion is doing is supporting the existing law in the country”. Why will they not get up and do that? It is because there is another agenda.\n\nThe minister from Toronto is favouring his buddy, Gerald Schwartz from Toronto, who is a big fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada. That is the kind of politics that we have here today. It says an awful lot about the need for more free votes in the House of Commons where a member can get up and voice his or her concern without fear of losing a job as a parliamentary secretary or chairmanship of a committee.\n\nI have spoken to many members of the Liberal Party in the House who are dead set against what Gerald Schwartz is trying to do, who are not at all happy with the minister from Toronto and who are unhappy that the minister is talking about changing the rules to favour one airline over the other. Where are those people today? They are not going to get up and speak in support of the motion that is before the House.\n\nThis is a very important issue. I come from Saskatchewan. I come from a smaller market where we do not have many flights. We have very few flights by Canadian Airlines. We have a few more by Air Canada. We have very few flights in all. It is a captive market. The prices are very expensive in a small market like Regina or Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. People are very concerned about the future of the airline industry.\n\nIf the 10% rule goes through, how high does it have to go before in effect we lose control of an airline industry in the country to big financial institutions or big American airlines in the United States? I want members to think about that.\n\nEven the Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney, when it privatized Air Canada, brought in the 10% rule for a purpose. It was to make sure the airline remained in Canadian hands. That was the Conservative Party.\n\nHere we have a Liberal Party that is now more conservative than the Conservatives and more conservative than Brian Mulroney. It is a shame.\n\nI can see members across the way nodding their heads in agreement that it is a real shame. If this rule goes through, we are going to lose the airline industry and people know that. It is only a matter of time before the big airlines buy out the Canadian airline industry, buy out Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. Big institutions in the United States will invest money and buy out these Canadian airlines.\n\nThat is the issue today. If we had a true parliamentary democracy in the country, the vote this afternoon on this motion would, I think, be overwhelming in terms of support for the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. That is why we need change in terms of how the House governs itself.\n\nBefore my time expires, I have a couple of other things to say. One thing the government should consider is the federal government itself taking an equity position in a new national airline. I would suggest about 15%. I think 15% would give the people of the country, through the federal government, enough control to make sure that the industry stays in Canadian hands, that we have jobs here for Canadians, that rural communities and smaller communities will to be served, that the price which passengers pay when they fly on an airline will be reasonable regardless of the size of the Canadian market. I think that is one thing that can be done.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, probably sooner than later, we are going to end up with one national airline. We do not have the market to support two big national airlines. I do not think any other country in the world, except the United States and perhaps Australia, has more than one national airline. Of course Australians have to fly almost always when they leave their country. I do not think we have the market to have two big national, successful, economic airlines in this country.\n\nIf we are going to have one airline, the government should seriously look at the possibility of an equity stake in that airline. The public should have some input and some clout. The public should have a couple of people on the board of directors of the airline and have some say over the direction in which that airline will go.\n\nThose are some of the important issues we have to be debating today. I end by saying once again that we support the motion put forward by the Bloc. I think that the 10% rule will have to stay. If it goes, we are in danger of losing not only Air Canada, but Canadian as well within a few short years into the hands of investors from the United States.",

Sometimes there is a long distance between the two.\n\nI remember my grandfather telling me many years ago about the Liberal Party promising medicare in the campaign of 1919. I did not see medicare in this country until about 1965 after it was brought in by a CCF government in the province of Saskatchewan. There is a long distance between the principles of the Liberal Party and the action of the Liberal Party.\n\nI remember very well the Liberal Party campaigning in this House against the GST. Does anyone else remember that? I was here. I saw the Liberals filibuster on the GST in the House of Commons. They spoke in committee hour after hour, “If we are elected to government in this country, we will abolish the GST. We will get rid of the GST”. About the only one who stood by her word was the Minister of Canadian Heritage who resigned her seat and ran in a byelection because of her commitment on the GST. I remember those debates.\n\nI remember my friend from Prince Edward Island when he was the national president of the farmers union based in Saskatoon. I remember going out to his retirement and cheering him on as a good progressive left-wing thinker. Part of the reason was that he campaigned against the free trade deal. He was campaigning against NAFTA.\n\nHis Liberal Party was campaigning against NAFTA and the free trade deal. The Liberals were sitting in these benches calling Brian Mulroney a sell-out. They were elected and what happened? We are still part of the FTA. We are still part of NAFTA. There have been no changes, no amendments, nothing. We are now talking about selling our water. We are now part of the WTO. That former Canadian nationalist, Sergio Marchi,—I can use his name now as he is at the WTO—was campaigning against those deals. What is he doing now? He wants to expand them more and more.\n\nThat is the Liberal Party. Madam Speaker, I am sure if you were not in the chair you would get up and agree with me, because that is the history of the Liberal Party. Liberals say one thing and they do something else.\n\nWhen members of the Liberal Party campaign in the opposition, they campaign for the left and they sound like New Democrats. When they are in government they sound like Conservatives, except for the last few years when they have sounded like Reformers. The Reform Party has set the agenda for them.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate on the restructuring of Canada's airline industry, not necessarily to speak to the Bloc's motion. Usually when the Bloc brings something to the House it is a sort of myopic view of public policy. Here coincidentally, Air Canada's head office is in Montreal, Quebec and Air Canada does not want to see any change to the 10% rule. Therefore the Bloc has come in here supporting no change to the 10% rule.\n\nI would like to speak on the key issues here, which are the amount of Canadian ownership and control in any industry in Canada and the question of competition and service.\n\nThe 10% rule should be put in context. When Air Canada was privatized however many years ago that was, the policy intent was to ensure that the shareholdings were broadly held across Canada. The government brought in a 10% rule to ensure the shares were widely held.\n\nThe question now before the government is whether the 10% rule should be relaxed. It makes eminent good sense to have a look at that. That is all our government has said, that we should not rule out any options, that we should have a look at the 10% rule.\n\nThe 10% rule does not apply to Canadian Airlines. What is the magic of this 10% ownership rule? It has to do with how widely the shares are held. It has nothing to do with foreign ownership.\n\nTo argue, actually to cheat, to say that we should not bring any policies forward that do not comply with legislation, the next time Air Canada or any interest group phones me and says that we need to change these policies or legislation, I will tell them that I am sorry because the legislation is here and that is what we are working on, so we will not consider any proposals. That is what I would do.\n\nOur role is to legislate. We have a proposal in front of us which someone has asked us to look at. We must debate it. It is a good debate. Our government has said that parliamentarians are going to debate it.\n\nI will certainly be voting against the Bloc motion. In a public policy sense it does not make any sense. Why would we close down that door at this point in time?\n\nI would like to address the other hypocrisy I have seen in this debate. On the one hand the Reform Party says let the market decide, that the market should control these things, that it should determine what the best mix of air service and air structure is in Canada. Then the minute the government lays down some public policy principles, the Reform Party says that the government is interfering. The minute the government says that we should really look at the 10% rule, the Reform Party says we are creating favouritism. In fact we are creating favouritism the other way if we do not open that door because Canadian Airlines is not governed by the same 10% rule, not at all. We need to get serious in this debate.\n\nIn terms of the government's role, we came out with a set of five principles. To my mind that was what we needed to do, had to do and it is what we did. We said that rather than nickel and dime every single proposal or alternative that is out there, we are going to set a framework. The government has embellished that somewhat since the first five principles were set out. No matter what proposal we look at, the government should weigh it against these five public policy objectives. That is what our government did.\n\nI would like to reiterate those five policy principles. The government said that no matter what proposal comes forward, and by the way, we do not have any firm proposal right now because nothing has been approved by any shareholders. Once a proposal is approved, we will evaluate that proposal against these criteria: Do we have Canadian control and ownership? Will we have good competition and service to consumers? Will we have good pricing in Canada? Will we be able to serve small communities? What about the rights of employees? Will they be protected as best as they can?\n\nOf course safety underlines everything. That is the mission of Transport Canada. That is its number one objective. Safety is a concern in the context of any proposal that would come forward.\n\nOur government laid out the five principles. In fact, when the government relaxed section 47 of the Competition Act, I thought, naively perhaps, that maybe the airlines would start talking to each other.\n\nIn fact, the government's policy purpose may have been to have Canadian and Air Canada talk to each other to try to rationalize some of this excess capacity out of the system. It is no secret. People in Canada recognize that when there are two flights at the same time from Toronto to Calgary, one Canadian and one Air Canada, at 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m, and 10 a.m. It is called wing tip to wing tip flying on the same routes. We cannot have the luxury of that kind of excess capacity.\n\nSome pilots will say that the planes are sort of full. Probably they are, but at what price? We know the way the pricing is done these days. There are about 60 different prices. About 80% of the people sitting in that plane are covering the variable costs maybe, but that is about it. Airlines cannot survive that way, Canadian or Air Canada.\n\nWe know Canadian Airlines is in deeper trouble, but Air Canada really has not performed that well over the last 10 years either. We have excess capacity and we have to deal with it. We cannot hide. We cannot run. We have to deal with it.\n\nCanadian ownership is an issue that is important to all Canadians. Frankly, I do not think we should compromise on the 25% rule at all.\n\nIn terms of the proposals we have in front of us, at least in terms of propositions, the question becomes how do they stand against that test? There has been a lot of misinformation about that in my view.\n\nThe Onex proposal is really proposing that American Airlines would have about 15% of Canadian. In fact, its shareholding goes down. In terms of its equity participation I think it is one member of the board of directors, or two out of thirteen, something in that order. We know that is not effective control.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency will rigorously look at any proposal that comes forward. It will deal with the question, is it effective Canadian control?\n\nThe ringer, the hook, is in all the side agreements. There are side agreements with American Airlines and Canadian. We know about the reservation systems, maintenance.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency will look at any proposals. It will study them and come back to the government and say that it has looked at them in some detail. The agency will say that it has looked at every single agreement that Canadian Airlines has with American Airlines and that from a policy perspective it is either effectively controlled in Canada or it is not. However, it is a valid public debate to have notwithstanding that we do not have all those facts in front of us.\n\nAnother aspect is the Competition Bureau. Its criteria is what does it do to competition. It does not have to worry about effective control or Canadian control. It just has to answer the question what is in the best interest of competition.\n\nThat is a very valid question but the bureau does not have to worry. If we look at cabotage, it means that we would open up our doors and allow foreign airlines to come in, pick up passengers in Toronto and take them to Calgary. It could be American Airlines, United or whatever. The bottom line in my view is that with the economies of scale of some of the huge American airlines our airline or airlines would be hard pressed to compete.\n\nWhy would we allow cabotage in Canada without getting the reverse, for example, in the United States? That would be folly. I do not think the Americans are prepared to allow cabotage in the United States. That to me is not an option.\n\nThe Competition Bureau clearly has a role to play. We are essentially looking at a one airline policy in Canada. Anyone who thinks that we cannot do anything about that is not really thinking through the facts. As a government we have a lot of options.\n\nWe could look at reregulating the industry. It is not an option that I would support, but we could do that in some limited way. I am very concerned about service to remote areas of Canada and some areas that might be marginal.\n\nHowever, if we give an airline a chance to rationalize some of that capacity, instead of 12 flights a day into certain centres by Air Canada and 12 by Canadian Airlines almost at the same time maybe we would end up with 8 in those centres but we would have service to other areas on a much more frequent basis.\n\nHow do we structure that? We cannot structure it on the basis of hope. We have to put some policy meat on those bones. Our government through debates and discussions with all parliamentarians should consider that.\n\nI do not like either of the deals that have been proposed the way they stand right now. I understand that Onex has come back with something today. It is trying to limit the perception of American Airlines effective control, but until we see all the side deals I do not know if we can really deal with that.\n\nI am glad these companies are at least thinking of how they can try to meet the public policy objectives of the government. I looked at the Air Canada proposal. In my mind I saw one proposal that was a heavy, dominant American Airlines proposal and another one with Lufthansa and United. It was sort of like pick our poison. We have some work to do.\n\nI would have liked to have seen one airline do the major financing in Canada. I am not convinced that it cannot be done. Why can it not be financed in Canada?\n\nI am not sure that the Air Canada proposal deals effectively with excess capacity. They are going to run Air Canada. They are going to run Canadian Airlines as a separate entity. They are going to throw in a computer discount airline into Hamilton. What does that do to our capacity? By the same token, unless the new Onex deal has some interesting propositions with respect to American Airlines effective control I think that proposal is problematic.\n\nI remember being at the transport committee one day when we were looking at the competitiveness of the air transportation sector. I asked a pilot group or some group about code sharing on domestic routes. All the airlines do code sharing internationally. Instead of having both a Canadian Airlines and an Air Canada flight leaving Toronto at 7 p.m. to go to Calgary, why would they not code share that?\n\nNaively I thought when the government relaxed section 47 that the airlines would talk. All they have done is gone off their own separate ways and now we are into mergers. Maybe a merger is the only solution. The airlines say it is.\n\nI was hoping that while they had this opportunity they could actually talk about rationalizing some of the excess capacity. On the notion of cherry-picking routes, Air Canada proposed to Canadian Airlines that it would take its international routes. That is where Canadian Airlines makes its money. Is that really working toward a solution?\n\nThe airlines have to get serious about dealing with this issue. I would like to see a little more creativity and imagination because at the end of the day we will have some very tough policy questions in the House. I am not sure that we are getting much closer. I really hope that we can.\n\nAir Canada pilots have been to see me in my riding of Etobicoke North, which is very close to the airport. The seniority issues are very serious for Air Canada pilots. Whatever happens I would like to see the airlines, if merger has to be the solution, deal with it in a very complete and concrete way.\n\nIf merger is the only answer there are some exciting possibilities. For too long in Canada we had Canadian Airlines and Air Canada beating each other up, sometimes deliberately, while at the same time the international carriers were coming in and picking up our business.\n\nIf we end up with one airline with some rules and benchmarks in terms of competition and service, it will be our job as legislators to put that into play. I think the prospects are incredible exciting. We can then take on the world with whatever airline comes out of this and actually create a very profitable airline that serves all Canadians very well. We are not there yet and still have some more work to do.\n\nThere is the question of providing a regulatory framework. We have Canadian Airlines and Air Canada with regional carriers. Some of the regional carriers like Air Nova, Air Ontario and Canadian Regional are owned by the major airlines. Somehow there has to be some rationalization of that capacity. I am not quite sure how that will work without ending up with a monopoly situation.\n\nI look back to an experience in Toronto of a few years ago when we had a neat little airline called City Express. It was flying out of Toronto Island, Montreal and Ottawa. Some entrepreneurs put together the airline using Dash 8s. It was a great service. It was going very well. Suddenly Air Ontario came in with deep pockets and priced City Express out.\n\nI am concerned about that. How do we make sure that if we have a monopoly type situation there will be competition. I am hopeful we can reach some sensible conclusions around that. We talk about the rhetoric of a two airline policy but in Canada we have about a six airline policy. There was a time when it was Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, but now we have some very serious players in the market; Air Transat, Canada 3000 and the WestJet.\n\nAs long as we can create an environment that is friendly to them and if we end up with one airline, perhaps that will be part of the solution on competition. We really have to apply our minds. The airline industry has to be much more creative. I do not want to pick on Air Canada, but frankly I am not that keen on the Onex bid either.\n\nTo line up Lufthansa and United and flow the money through to the shareholders, throw something into Hamilton and not deal with the capacity issue, would not be highly constructive. I am not sure that what is on their minds is picking up the pieces of Canadian Airlines.\n\nI know we have talked about it but I will put it on the floor here. I do not think Canadians have a big appetite for that. The Government of Canada assigns the international routes. The other day I asked someone from Air Canada whether Air Canada presumes the international routes, if Canadian Airlines flounders, would be allocated without any question to the new Air Canada. It seems to me that our government would have options. I do not know. I am not privy to those considerations of the government. We could take Air Canada's international routes and give them to Air Transat or Canada 3000. Why are we obliged to give them to any surviving airline? We have options.\n\nI hope that all the players in the industry would stop playing games, apply their minds, be creative and try to come forward with propositions that meet our public policy objectives and the concerns and needs of all Canadians. As legislatures let us get down to the business of setting the policy framework that will make this happen in a way that is acceptable to the Government of Canada and to all Canadians.",

That was done so that the shares would be widely distributed across Canada. I was not there at the time, but it was probably a sensible policy decision. My colleague was there and he agrees with me. The irony is that there is no such requirement for Canadian Airlines.\n\nForeign ownership is another interesting twist. In the Onex proposal, American Airlines would actually own less of Canadian Airlines than it owns today. I think it owns about 34% or 35% today. That would come down to about 15%. How can we apply one standard for Air Canada and another for Canadian Airlines?\n\nThe policy objective of widely distributing participation in Air Canada has been met. Why do we perpetuate this? It is a good debating point, but to me it does not make any sense to close down the option until we have had a discussion about it. Frankly, I do not see the public policy objective.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that when Canadian Airlines was in severe financial difficulty American Airlines came in, put a lot of money into Canadian and sewed up a lot of agreements which, in the final analysis, as a business proposition, was probably the thing that had to be done. However, at the end of the day, Canadian has been strapped with some agreements which have really hampered it.\n\nI am not very happy with the extent of control American Airlines might have over Canadian the way it is structured now. However, I gather that Onex has come forward this afternoon with a new proposal and I will read it with interest.",

He started at one point in the circle and he chased himself all the way around the circle. I will ask him a direct question which has to do with foreign ownership.\n\nOn October 26 the minister said that he would address the 10% foreign ownership regulation. He said that he would take another look at it. That has not happened yet, but there is a lot of discussion on it. The minister is willing to look at it. We now have a new Onex bid, with direct Liberal connections, that is apparently proposing 14.5% foreign ownership.\n\nIf the minister wanted to open this up for direct competition, would it not have been better to open up the foreign ownership bid early on when the Competition Act was cancelled? When the foreign ownership part is opened up 78 days later there are fewer people willing to put a bid together in the timeframe that is left during the 90 days when the regulations of the Competition Act have been suspended.\n\nWe are stifling competition. We are allowing one person to bid because they have already done their homework, they have already spent millions of dollars, and they already know how much and what limit they can reach.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will answer on two fronts. First of all, the member is in error. As many Canadians are doing, he is mixing up the 10% ownership rule with the foreign ownership rule.\n\nThe 10% rule means that for Air Canada, not Canadian Airlines, no single person or body can own more than 10% of Air Canada. That was implemented when Air Canada was privatized. The foreign ownership rule is the 25% rule.\n\nWhen the Onex proposal came forward it was in the form of a proposition. Clearly, if the government at that point in time had a policy decision that it was not going to contemplate increasing the 10% rule, the government would have said so. Onex would not have proceeded up to this point if it did not feel the government was open to that discussion.\n\nI find it amazing that Air Canada would be so dogmatic about the 10% rule. I think it is somewhat self-serving. If Air Canada came forward with a proposal which violated the 10% rule, my take on that would be that it would be saying that it does not meet the requirements of the law of the land now, but it would respectfully submit that there is a proposal on the floor which now exceeds the rule and it would like its proposal to be considered as well.\n\nWe are legislators. When people talk to us they ask us to legislate. Why is it so impossible for someone to say that we should reconsider the 10% rule?\n\nAt times, when it is convenient, people hide behind these rules. No one has actually increased the 10%. No one has done that. No one has violated the law of the land. Someone has come forward and said that perhaps we should reconsider. Frankly, if Air Canada had done the same I do not know how our government could possibly have said “You cannot do that”, because we did not say that to Onex.\n\nI am fully confident that if Air Canada had come forward with that proposition we would have had the same kind of policy framework that has been articulated more recently by the minister.\n\nAre we playing games or are we interested in solutions? Let us try to work on this.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would indicate at the outset that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Kings—Hants.\n\nI am very pleased to rise to take part in the debate, a debate which I think has caused a great deal of uneasiness. There have obviously been even elements of consternation in the debate today.\n\nAs we have seen in a number of instances, it appears that the government is now lapsing into crisis management. We have seen it in the fisheries as a result of the Marshall decision. We have seen it in the debate over the pay equity settlement. Let us hope that this particular situation is not going wind up before the courts. The hon. member who just spoke has indicated, quite rightly, that we as legislators have to deal with situations such as this.\n\nI want to congratulate the Bloc for bringing this motion forward. The timeliness of it is extremely important. It is an issue that is moving along at breakneck pace and one which has not been handled particularly well by the government.\n\nWe will be supporting the motion because the motives behind the proposal to increase the ownership limit of Air Canada, the 10% rule, and the 10% public participation rule, are very important and credible and should be considered free of all outside influences. The 10% rule is one of the issues that is at the very crux of this debate, as well as the confidence that Canadians have in the deals which are being proposed and the solutions to this crisis in our airline that are being brought forward and supported, for the most part, by the government.\n\nThe current proposal calls for a change to the 10% rule. This is one change that would be completely influenced by one proposal over another on the issue of merger. It shows and smacks of favouritism.\n\nThe process itself is one that has been fraught with a great deal of misinformation and a great deal of confusion. The government's timing of the announcement with respect to the suspension of the Competition Act was something else that caused a great deal of concern on the part of all Canadians and a great deal of concern in particular in the business community because it has broad, far-reaching implications for all business practitioners in the country.\n\nThe proposal to change the 10% rule at the beginning of the 90 day negotiation period might have been acceptable. It might have been acceptable. It would certainly have been more acceptable than what we have occurring in this instance, which is, 16 days before the end of the 90 day suspension of the Competition Act, we have the government basically moving the goal posts, changing the rules of engagement and allowing, without any doubt, a very undue and unfair advantage to one of the proponents, one of the proposed businesses that looked to engage and take over what is our national airline, or our two national airlines.\n\nTo put this in its proper context, with 16 days to go in the 90 day window for negotiation, the government suddenly, out of the blue, announced a plan to change the 10% ownership rule. That left absolutely no time for any serious offer or any serious business to come forward and develop, or at least put into the mix a bid with respect to this offer. The new proposal, if it were to come, would be at an unfair advantage. Even if a proposal could be made within the 16 day period, it would be completely unfair compared to a proposal made by, in this case, one of the proponents in the time period it has had. The timing itself is something that is extremely suspect and extremely tenuous when it comes down to the issue of fairness and competition, which is what is at the very root of this issue.\n\nOn the issue of the 10% rule, the proposal to change the 10% rule at this late date strongly demonstrates that the government is flying by the seat of its pants, improvising daily as to how to react or respond to the various businesses that are currently involved. As I said before, the crux of the issue is that there could have been more. In a competitive business world what we would surely want when it comes to our national airline is to have the best proposals and the best options to choose from. It is a very fundamental motherhood issue.\n\nAs the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester put it, in terms that Canadians can understand, if we are going out to Canadian Tire to buy a toaster, we are not going to buy one brand of toaster without looking at the various options that are available. Compare that to having national airlines worth billions of dollars and the suggestion that we should simply buy this one because it has been proposed and it is the only option that is available because the government tells us so. Behind the scenes we know that is not the case. This is not a situation where there was fair competition, where the rules that applied to one business applied to all. It is at the very fundamental root of the Competition Act that this is the case.\n\nThe Competition Act was suspended. The rules were pulled away and, very curiously, the minister asked that the bureau look at a very narrow part of this deal. He has chosen to take out of the mix the normal scrutiny that would be applied by the bureau and he has, for all intents and purposes, emasculated the Competition Bureau and given it a very specific mandate as to what it should look at in the context of this deal. He has said: “The minister's option is the preferred option and therefore I am going to point you in that direction. I am not going to ask you to look at the entire situation as you normally would if the Competition Act were in full force and effect, but I am going to suggest that you take this particular aspect of your job and you follow it. In the meantime, I will continue to oversee the situation”. It was a very paternalistic and narrow view taken by the minister. The effect at the end of the day is that we may wind up with a dominant carrier approach which will not serve Canadians well.\n\nOne of the other fundamental motherhood issues is how this will affect jobs, how it will affect the employment situation in the country. The Canadian aviation industry includes thousands of employees in all regions of the country. Again I congratulate the Bloc for bringing the matter forward, but this is not limited to any one region of the country. It has drastic implications in the west, in the east, in the north and all over the country. More than anything else, this is something the government has to constantly have at the front of its mind and hopefully on its priority list, as to how it examines, manages or mismanages this issue.\n\nWhat is the effect going to be on jobs in this country? There are dozens of smaller airlines that will obviously be affected as well, and there are hundreds of airports and hundreds of communities, in terms of being isolated in the service that will be provided to them, which will be affected in a profound way if this issue is not resolved in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nThis is not a new situation. It is something the government surely should have seen coming down the pike, but again, somehow, for some reason which is beyond me and beyond the understanding of many Canadians, the government is not reacting. It is simply improvising and reacting in a day to day way, as opposed to having some sort of concrete or deliberate path that it is following, giving Canadians the confidence they should have in their national government.\n\nI again hearken back to the issue of employment. The government is proposing to completely restructure and revamp our national airline in 90 days. That is less than the gestation period of a mayfly. Somehow the government wants to completely change our national airline and asks Canadians to have faith in the process, all the while changing the rules of engagement as it goes along.\n\nThis is not something that should instil a great deal of confidence in Canadians. It is something we should slow down and something we should look at extremely carefully. We should ensure that those who are in the know are actually making the right decisions.\n\nPart of the problem here is that we do not know who is in the know. We do not know what information is available. We do not know when the information was released that the Competition Act would be suspended. We do not what information was exchanged between the various airlines prior to the suspension of the Competition Act.\n\nWe must be extremely diligent in the way we proceed in the next number of days, months and years because the effect is going to be profound and potentially devastating on communities in the country.\n\nI wish Godspeed to the minister and to the transportation committee as they proceed in their deliberations because this is a very serious issue. I am hoping and putting trust in those members of the committee that they are going to hold to account the government on this matter.",

I would never want to mislead the House or misrepresent the facts in the debate. My understanding is that the minister has floated the idea of changing the 10% rule. He has not said that he would or he would not.\n\nHowever, the crux of the matter is that this causes confusion within the industry. This causes the participants in the debate to feel like they are on unstable ground as to what is going to happen next. The lack of policy, the lack of leadership and firm commitment as to what the rules of engagement are, is causing a great deal of misunderstanding, mistrust and confusion among the proponents and among Canadians.\n\nI would encourage the minister to be perhaps more definitive and more diligent in making his position clear to Canadians and making his government's policy or plan clear to Canadians so that we do not have issues swirling out there in the public debate and this furore over what is going to happen and the confusion and consternation.

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on this very important issue. The future of the Canadian airlines industry is at stake and it is very important that we take this issue very seriously in the debate tonight.\n\nThe debate is about the 10% rule and that being the maximum that any one group can own of Air Canada. I am not defending the 10% rule. The issue before us should not be debated in the last stages of a negotiation period or in the last stages of a period during which the Competition Bureau has been suspended for at least one of the proposed mergers.\n\nThe 10% rule has inherently some flaws. It can help protect mediocre or even bad management. It can reduce shareholders equity and the competitiveness of a company. Potentially, there are even issues whereby the 10% rule could be seen as in violation of NAFTA seeing as the 10% rule was utilized in 1988 and apparently, if one reads the fine print, because of the fact that the privatization occurred before 1994 when NAFTA came into effect, this 10% rule may not be actually tenable under NAFTA. There are some real issues about the 10% rule.\n\nThe question is why are we not discussing the 10% rule and some of these other issues, including the cabotage issue, as part of the discussion of a general restructuring of the Canadian airline structure when we are not in the middle of a crisis? The difficulty here is that we always seem to get to a crisis position before we actually deal with some of the structural issues facing Canadians and the Canadian economy.\n\nIt is inappropriate to be trial ballooning significant changes in the nature or the structure of the Canadian airlines at such a difficult and heated time. We should have done this long before. I would argue that the suspension of the Competition Bureau's activities on the Onyx proposal should be considered an admission of failure by the government to lead and to actually provide some visionary restructuring to the Canadian airlines industry a lot sooner.\n\nThe fact that the Canadian airlines industry is having difficulty is nothing new. We have known this for a long time. In fact this government, which has been in power since 1993, has been aware of the challenges facing the Canadian airlines industry.\n\nThe consumers should not be asked to pay the price for the government's dilly-dallying, dithering and failure to address the major issues in a holistic, forward-thinking and visionary manner.\n\nThe minister stated in one of the papers I read this morning that he may be amenable to allowing foreigners to set up shop in Canada to provide Canadian based airline units with foreign-owned routes and servicing within Canada. Again, that is another issue that should be discussed when we are not in the heat of an airline crisis and in the heart of negotiations on at least two fronts now with two proposals.\n\nWe should have been discussing the 10% rule, the notion of cabotage and all these types of issues during a period of time when we were less rushed and when we were in less of a crisis environment.\n\nInstead of this crisis management, knee-jerk reaction that the government is taking now, we could have actually provided a framework to the airline industry to allow restructuring to occur as opposed to having the airline industry and entities within the airlines industry, in this case Canadian and Air Canada, actually having to come up with proposals. The government is effectively cutting the suit to fit the cloth on this one. It is not really providing the structural framework that one expects from governments for the private sector to respond in a more long term and meaningful way.\n\nThe government's approach to the airlines is very similar to the government's approach on the bank merger issue. Members will remember that about a year ago we were very heavily ensconced in the debate on the bank mergers issue? The government had ignored, from 1993 forward, some of the structural reforms necessary in the financial services sector until, at one point or another, there were private sector proposals that forced the government to make a decision on those specific proposals. In this case and currently, we are focused in Canada not on the holistic nature of reforming and restructuring the Canadian airlines, we are focused on two specific mergers.\n\nIn the bank merger situation, the whole focus of Canadians, which should have been on restructuring the Canadian financial services sector to provide an industry that was more capable of competing globally and at the same time meeting the needs of Canadians, was suddenly focused on two specific merger proposals. Unfortunately, this is not, in my opinion, the right approach to develop public policy in the long term interests of the competitiveness of Canadian industry and in the long term interests of protecting Canadian consumers.\n\nSince the government's merger decision in the financial services sector, we have seen some of the ramifications or repercussions of that decision. We have heard the Bank of Montreal announce layoffs of 1,400 workers in direct response to the merger decision. We have heard the Bank of Montreal announce that 100 branches will close. Members should keep in mind that one of the conditions that the banks had agreed to if the mergers were allowed was to maintain branch operations, to service all the rural communities currently being serviced and to maintain current levels of employment.\n\nThe finance minister, dealing with a crisis within his own leadership aspirations and trying to shore up support among the backbenchers, allowed for a Liberal caucus revolt. The Liberal caucus witch hunt on banks occurred. What we saw was an uprising within the Liberal backbenchers that effectively prevented a focus on public policy that would have been in the long term interests of the Canadian industry or in the long term interests of Canadian customers.\n\nIt is also important to realize that there has been a $7.2 billion loss in bank shareholder capital in Canada since that decision. During the same period in the U.S. there has been a 7.4% increase in shareholder value with U.S. banks. This is very important given that 7.5 million Canadians are bank shareholders, directly or indirectly.\n\nWe have seen 1,400 jobs lost just with one of the banks involved since then because of the merger decision. The Dominion Bond Rating Service has downgraded Canadian banks, directly attributing its decision to do that to the Minister of Finance's decision. There has been a loss of market capital and a compromising of the ability of Canadians to save and invest for their future, in many cases for their retirement, all because of that decision.\n\nMy concern is here we are again focused on specific merger proposals and not dealing with the issues in a long term revisionary way. It is in stark contrast to the previous Conservative government's vision and courage to tackle the real issues not just facing Canadians today or tomorrow, but facing Canadians in the next century.\n\nThis government would not have had the courage to pursue a free trade agreement. This government would not have had the courage or vision to implement a significant tax reform and some tax policies that were not popular but proved to be the right policies in the long term. I do not believe this government would have had the foresight and vision and courage to implement some of the deregulation policies in financial services, transportation and energy.\n\nInstead, here we are again in the heat of merger discussions coming up with policies to try to deal with specific mergers proposed by the private sector, having failed to provide a long term approach before a crisis situation. The government's approach to this issue and most issues it faces is one of crisis management. It is a knee-jerk reaction. It is analogous to someone installing a sprinkler system while the house is on fire. It is simply no way to run a railway as one saying goes. It is no way to run an airline either, but it is also no way to run a government.",

He probably was a young student in 1982 and he may not remember why Bill S-31, limiting to 10% the ownership of any company by a buying company, was introduced at that time.\n\nThe Caisse de dépôt et placement intended to get substantial ownership of Canadian Pacific. The prime minister of the day—all the members will recall that it was a certain Pierre Trudeau who did not like Quebec very much and who feared Quebec's influence in everything—had Bill S-31 passed. It was to prevent the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec from buying Canadian Pacific. I must tell you that it was not the loftiest of initiatives.\n\nNow we see that the government, to favour its friends, to allow the Liberal Party's bagman buy Air Canada, will use this legislation to let Onex become part owner of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines.\n\nI hope my colleague from Kings—Hants will remember that.

However, I have a great deal of respect for my hon. colleague, and I can say that the types of policies that governments implemented in 1982 and in fact in the 1970s were very different. I believe that even the Liberals realize that part of the reason is that we are operating in a global environment. We are dealing with many global realities which are quite different from those which existed in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIt is very difficult for me to compare those two issues because I believe we are dealing with profoundly different global competitiveness issues today. What may have been appropriate then would probably not be appropriate now in a policy sense.

We were in favour at that time of the Minister of Finance negotiating the best deal on behalf of Canadians. He had the opportunity to do that because the banks were willing to commit to 10% reductions in services charges, services to rural communities and branch openings and maintaining jobs with Canadian banks. Unfortunately the Minister of Finance blew that opportunity. He was so focused on the short term politics of the issue that he forgot about the long term interests of Canadians. That is the crux of that issue.\n\nRelative to the crisis the government found itself in this summer on the airline industry and Canadian Airlines, I would suggest to the minister a more forward thinking and visionary approach over the past several years in restructuring the Canadian airlines industry in advance of this kind of crisis would have prevented this evolution of events.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, the discussion has been exciting and debate during the day has been very interesting.\n\nI will continue to deal with some of the issues that have been presented. I realize that some of the concepts I will present will be repetitive but we all know that if we repeat things often enough it leads to an effective learning experience.\n\nI commend the Minister of Transport for his presentation on this subject before the House and the Senate standing committees on Tuesday and the policy framework document he tabled. He has shed a great deal of light on a topic that has been of consuming interest to members of the House and to Canadians for several months.\n\nThe government position is now known. Private sector parties will now be able to act with full knowledge of the government's policy framework and the process announced by the minister that will be used to approve and condition any proposal to restructure the airline industry.\n\nI would particularly like to address two important issues raised last Tuesday by the minister. Those have been the central theme for much of today's debate. The first was the limit on ownership of Air Canada's voting shares established in the Air Canada Public Participation Act at 10%. The second was the limitation on foreign ownership of any Canadian air carrier and the requirement for Canadian control that are established in the Canada Transportation Act.\n\nThose two issues are often confused. They sound so similar but they address different concepts. Both issues are very relevant to airline restructuring and both were addressed by the Minister of Transport in his policy framework and his statements.\n\nI hope that by addressing them together I will not only be able to illuminate two quite technical issues, but also to clear up any confusion that may exist between them in the minds of some members of the House. Some members are quite confused.\n\nThe 25% limit on voting shares held by foreign investors applies to all Canadian carriers, including Air Canada. It is an aggregate figure such that it places an upper limit on the ability of non-Canadians acting separately or in concert with others to influence the result of any shareholder vote. This quantitative limit is accompanied in the Canada Transportation Act by a qualitative test of control in fact by Canadians.\n\nResponsibility for applying the ownership limit and the control test lies with the Canadian Transportation Agency, a quasi-judicial body that operates at arm's length from the government and the Minister of Transport. Those are very important points.\n\nThe other feature to note is that both the 25% test and the requirement for control in fact are ongoing obligations that are assessed before the airline is originally licensed to operate as a Canadian air carrier. That can be reassessed at any time based on developments with the airline that affect its ownership and governance, or on any other new information that may come to the agency's attention at any future time, or on the basis of complaint.\n\nThe purpose of these two tests, which together I will refer to as the Canadian ownership and control rules, is straightforward. The purpose is to ensure that all Canadian air carriers are owned and controlled by Canadians, that is, that this industry which is so key to all Canadians remains Canadian in the full sense of the term.\n\nMoving now to a consideration of the 10% rule, this rule applies to Air Canada only as it appears in the Air Canada Public Participation Act, not the Canada Transportation Act or any other federal act of general application. No other airline in Canada is subject to such a rule, although this has not always been the case. Until 18 months ago, Canadian Airlines was subject to a similar restriction left over from the time it was owned by the province of Alberta. The provision was rescinded by the Alberta government in 1997.\n\nThe 10% rule is not aimed at non-Canadians per se. It applies to all shareholders, both Canadian and non-Canadian. This rule applies to any individuals as well as to individuals acting together, such that shareholders are expressly forbidden from entering into any agreement that would allow any person, together with the associates of that person, to own or control directly or indirectly voting shares which represent more than 10% of the votes that may be cast to elect members of the board of directors of Air Canada.\n\nThe 10% rule was included in the Air Canada Public Participation Act when it was passed in 1988 in order to ensure that Air Canada remained widely held. As I understand it, the idea was that Air Canada was already widely held in that it was a crown corporation owned in equal measure by all Canadians. So when the airline was privatized, parliament was loath to contemplate that this national carrier might some day be owned and controlled by any individual or group, even recognizing that they would be Canadians as provided for by the Canadian ownership and control rules. It appears that this idea was sufficiently persuasive on its face that it received little debate among Canadians in the media or in parliament at that time and became part of the legislation that governs Air Canada to this very day.\n\nThe point to be clear on is that the 10% limit is not, and I repeat not—",
