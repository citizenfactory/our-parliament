            "text": "I will now deliver my ruling on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Athabasca concerning the use of his signature in support of Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information Act and to make amendments to other acts, in the name of the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington.\n\nThe bill was originally introduced during the previous session, on October 23, 1997, as Bill C-264. The member for Wentworth—Burlington gathered over 100 signatures in support of this bill, including the signature of the hon. member for Athabasca.\n\nOn June 11, 1998, by unanimous consent, a different text was substituted for the original text of Bill C-264. In the second session this bill was reinstated on October 14, 1999, in the same form as at prorogation.\n\nIn accordance with Standing Order 87(6) the bill, supported by 100 signatures, was placed on the order of precedence.\n\nThe complaint of the hon. member for Athabasca arises from the use made of his signature in helping to have his revised bill placed on the order of precedence. This support, he maintained, was limited to Bill C-264 in its original form and the use of his signature for any other purpose constituted “false representation to gain unjust advantage”.\n\nThe hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington claimed that he never intended to mislead the House by his use of the list nor did he feel that its use in support of Bill C-206 was illegitimate.\n\nIn his view, the signatures indicated only that the issue at which the bill was aimed was one deserving of debate. He further maintained that the revisions to the bill in the previous session were, for the most part, of a technical nature and that no one had indicated any difficulty concerning them in the 19 months since they were placed before the House.\n\nI point out to all hon. members that the procedure at the heart of this issue is a relatively new one. Standing Order 87(6) came into effect on February 1, 1999, as part of a small number of changes to our standing orders designed to further increase the opportunities that private members have to present their initiatives for debate.\n\nThe first paragraph of the standing order reads as follows:\n\nAt any time after the holding of the first draw in a Session, a Member may file with the Clerk a list containing the signatures of one hundred Members, including at least ten Members each from a majority of the recognized parties in the House, who support a specific item, sponsored by the Member, eligible to be placed in the order of precedence.\n\nAn item supported in this way is then placed in the order of precedence provided that the member presenting it does not already have another item there and that only one such item at any time may be placed in the order.\n\nAs I said, this is a new procedure. The bill presented by the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington is only the second to have been placed in the order of precedence pursuant to this standing order. There are no previous rulings to which the Speaker can turn for guidance in such a case, nor were comments made in the House prior to the adoption of these new standing orders which might be of assistance.\n\nA member signing such a list does not appear to be seconding the item, for which we have other procedures, but the exact meaning of placing a signature on the list is not clear. Does such a signature represent support for the content of the item, or simply that the item be given precedence?\n\nIf our new procedures to increase the opportunity of members to present their own initiatives are to be a success, we must ensure that we proceed on the basis of a common understanding and agreement as to how the rules governing them are to function.\n\nWhile I have my own views on these matters, it is not my role as Speaker to impose them on the House. There does not, at first glance, appear to have been any actions carried out other than in good faith. However, given that important questions have been raised about how this procedure should work, I feel that it would be unfair to the House and to the hon. members concerned to simply turn our backs on this problem.\n\nI am not disposed to give a final ruling at this time. This, in my opinion, is an issue which should be considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs so that the Speaker has guidance about how to proceed both with Bill C-206 and with future cases related to Standing Order 87(6). I would ask the committee to give its attention to this issue as an urgent matter.\n\nIn order to afford the committee time to examine the questions raised concerning this matter, I am ordering, pursuant to the power afforded me by Standing Order 94(1)(a), that Bill C-206 be dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence. When we have had the benefit of the committee's advice I will make a further ruling if it is necessary at that time.\n\nI would like to thank the hon. member for Athabasca, the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington, as well as the other members who contributed to the discussion of this issue which relates to the fundamental nature of our relations with one another in the House.",

            "text": "(a) The question asks about spousal benefits in federal legislation. It is difficult to define such a term as federal legislative treatment of spousal relationships includes direct economic benefits, indirect economic benefits, non-economic advantages and obligations. Listed are the major federal statutes which grant direct economic benefits. Some statutes which grant direct economic benefits to dependants may not be reflected in the list. The majority of the statutes listed set out criteria for eligibility beyond spousal status. For example, some are available only to low income couples, others to federal employees, and yet others provide for garnishment of wages and pensions in the case of court ordered support.\n\nEmployment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23;\n\nMerchant Navy Veteran and Civilian War-related Benefits Act,\n\nPension Benefits Division Act, S.C. 1992, c. 46 Sch. II;\n\nSome federal statutes such as the Income Tax Act involve a mixture of potential benefits and obligations depending on individual circumstance. b ) Spousal benefits in federal legislation have been extended to same sex couples only in respect to employment-related pensions for federal public servants in Bill C-78, an act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to another act, which amended the following six statutes:\n\n(c) Bill C-78 received royal assent on September 14, 1999.\n\nOther employment-related benefits were extended to federal public service employees by the treasury board with regard to their same sex partners under employment agreements in November 1995 for bereavement leave, family related responsibility leave and relocation leave and in July 1996 for medical and dental plans.\n\n(d) As mention in (b), the changes to the federal public service pension plans were introduced through legislation, Bill C-78. However a series of recent court and tribunal decisions have found generally that there must be equal treatment of opposite-sex common law couples and same sex couples in most instances. The government continues to believe that policy and legislative changes should be made by parliament, but that it is reasonable to seek the guidance of the courts on difficult legal issues.\n\nThe major court and tribunal decisions include: The provision of the Income Tax Act which allows employers to register pension plans was ruled contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Rosenberg decision, as it did not allow registation of pension plans where employers chose to offer survivor benefits to same sex partners of employees, Ontario Court of Appeal, 1998. The decision of the Federal Court, Trial Division in Moore and Akerstrom affirmed the decision of the Human Rights Tribunal that the federal government must grant the same employment benefits under collective agreements to same sex couples as those offered to common law spouses of public service employees, 1998. In May of 1999, two challenges before the Pension Appeals Board to the survivor benefit provisions of the Canada Pension Plan were conceded, Hodder and Boulais, and a similar case was conceded before the Federal Court of Appeal in September, Fisk, resulting in a payment of survivor benefits to the three individuals involved. In November 1999, the Government of Canada settled a number of cases, including White, which involved the challenge to the voluntary quit provisions of the Employment Insurance Act. There are a number of arbitral decisions and decisions under provincial jurisdiction which have also awarded benefits to same sex couples, including the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in M. v H., (May 1999). There are many pending court cases in this area.\n\nQuestion No. 20—",

Currently the 0.50 calibre machine gun capability of the RCMP is restricted to the armoured public and police safety vehicle program and could be deployed when there is a requirement for the protection provided by such vehicles.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time this morning with my colleague, the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill.\n\nOur subject will be the supply motion which deplores the mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars by the Department of Human Resources Development and expresses our total lack of confidence in the minister. If the motion is carried by the House, the minister would be obliged to resign.\n\nIn the course of the debate, my colleagues and others will be laying before the House the evidence that taxpayers' funds have been grossly mismanaged by the minister. In my remarks, however, I want to address violations of the principle of ministerial accountability by the Minister of Human Resources Development, violations which in themselves should oblige the resignation of the minister.\n\nThere are many definitions of the principle of ministerial accountability but one of the latest and best is contained in Erskine May's treatise on the law of privileges, proceedings and usages of parliament, the 22nd edition, 1997. It reads as follows:\n\n...the following principles should govern the conduct of ministers of the Crown in relation to Parliament: ministers have a duty to parliament to account, and to be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and Next Step Agencies; it is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest possible opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister;\n\nAs hon. members know, the handling of money through the transitional jobs fund has been suspect for years. Numerous questions have been asked concerning its administration, particularly respecting funds allocated to the Prime Minister's riding during the last session of the House.\n\nAs late as December of last year, inside and outside the House, the minister repeatedly denied that there were any problems worthy of concern. The appropriate approval processes were being followed. No moneys flowed until the approval process was completed. Nothing inappropriate was done. On and on she went denying any mismanagement and constantly affirming that all was well.\n\nNow we discover that while the minister was making these very statements to the House, she had on her desk a departmental audit covering some 459 project files which revealed the following: 72% of the projects reviewed had no cashflow forecast; 46% had no estimate of the number of participants; 25% had no description of the activities to be supported; 25% provided no description of the characteristics of the participants; 11% did not even have a budget proposal; 11% had no description of expected results; 15% did not have an application on file from the sponsor; 8 out 10 files reviewed did not show evidence of financial monitoring; 87% of project files reviewed showed no evidence of supervision; and 97% of the files reviewed showed no evidence that anyone had checked to see if the recipient already owed money to the government.\n\nThis is overwhelming evidence of gross mismanagement of taxpayers' money. However, the fact that the minister knew these things and continually repeated and reassured the House that all was well, is an obvious violation of the minister's obligation to give accurate and truthful information to parliament. Because the minister has repeatedly violated this principle, the House should express its lack of confidence in the minister by passing the motion and she should resign.\n\nIn enforcing the principle of ministerial accountability, it is imperative that the House dig deeper into the root causes of ministerial accountability for funds spent by the human resources ministry. Here the trail leads right back to the Prime Minister himself and the use or misuse of the transitional jobs fund.\n\nPrior to becoming Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister said in 1991:\n\nWhen we form government, every minister in the cabinet...will have to take full responsibility for what is going on in his department. If there is any bungling in the department, ...the minister will have to take responsibility.\n\nThis was a statement of ministerial accountability by the Prime Minister but it has never been put into practice. The Prime Minister's ability to put it into practice has been compromised by his own conduct with respect to the use of the transitional jobs fund in his own riding.\n\nWhen a transitional jobs fund grant was put into a trust fund to help a failing company in the Prime Minister's riding and someone eventually got $1.19 million from the suspect trust fund, which later proved to be illegal; when that someone was Claude Gauthier who had already purchased land from the Prime Minister's golf course and donated $10,000 to the Prime Minister's election campaign; when the business then being run by Gauthier got the money and laid off all but 62 of the original 115 employees for a net job loss of 53 jobs, all this done in the name of job creation; when Mr. Gauthier had already received a $6 million CIDA government contract; when another $11,000 got into the hands of René Fugère, a man who was under RCMP investigation for doing illegal lobbying for three other companies; when, in a memo to a department official, one of the human resources minister's staff instructed that the dollar amounts given to the two hotels in the Prime Minister's riding had to be artificially inflated to “keep the same amounts suggested by the Prime Minister during discussions with the promoters”.\n\nWhen all these things happened with human resources funds in the Prime Minister's riding, and the Prime Minister excuses these things and refuses to accept any responsibility, what message does this send to other ministers, the civil service and the public at large?\n\nIf the Prime Minister can play fast and loose with taxpayers' money, allocated under inadequate financial guidelines for job creation, what is to stop other ministers or MPs from doing the same thing? What is to stop high and lower level bureaucrats from assuming that this type of conduct and handling of federal funds is perfectly acceptable behaviour?\n\nOnce that happens, when there is no example of financial accountability, responsibility or integrity at the top, the fish rots from the head down. Now the little scandal in Shawinigan has mushroomed into a billion dollar boondoggle at human resources.\n\nThe Prime Minister refuses to enforce the principle of ministerial accountability in the case of the human resources development minister. Why? Because he lacks the moral authority to do so.\n\nIt is therefore the duty of the House to enforce ministerial accountability in this case. It can do so by simply supporting the motion that is before us.",

This is the money of Canadians and we must never forget that because Canadians work hard for the dollars they trust us with and in this case they have been sadly let down.\n\nIn the final analysis, we in the opposition can do our very best in the most competent, able manner we know to hold the government to account but in a democracy the people do rule. The people, in the final analysis, will have to decide what messages they will send to their elected representatives, what pressure they intend to put on the government and what they intend to do in giving their support to the people they want to entrust with their money.\n\nWe know how effective people can be. We saw this recently when the government made an extremely ill-advised effort to give $20 million to professional hockey clubs. The public outrage was so strong that the government immediately backed down.\n\nI would say to Canadians watching this debate that they need to make a judgment about what they will do, what they will say and what their attitude will be toward this situation.\n\nThe Liberals are saying that the opposition is exaggerating. Let me read from the audit report that was produced by the government. It is entitled “Program Integrity/Grants and Contributions”. The first part is a misnomer, I would say. The report is dated January 2000. I will read from page 7. I urge Canadians to get their hands on it and read it for themselves because I do not have time to read a lot of it.\n\nOf the 459 project files reviewed, 15% did not contain an application. This is not the opposition making an exaggerated statement; this is the government's own audit.\n\nOf the remaining applications, the following elements were missing: 72% were missing cash flow forecasts; 46% were missing the anticipated number of participants; 25% were missing a description of the activities to be supported; 25% were missing the characteristics of participants or the audience; 11% were missing a budget proposal; 11% were missing a description of expected results. There was no documentation on internal or external consultations in 70% of the project files reviewed. Two-thirds of the files reviewed did not contain an analysis or rationale for recommending or accepting the project. In 97% of the files reviewed, there was no evidence on file that sponsors had been checked for outstanding debts to HRDC prior to project acceptance. In 100% of the files there were no documented attempts made to identify debts outside of HRDC.\n\nThis is not an exaggeration by the opposition. This is the government's own document giving these horrendous numbers, proving government ineptitude and negligence of massive proportions in the handling of public money.\n\nThe Prime Minister is trying to say that only 37 projects are a problem. He said that 37 projects have some problems representing $30 million. Let me talk about the facts. The fact is that this audit was a representative sample of all the projects that spend $1 billion every year of taxpayers' and public money. If this is a representative sample, then it is not 37 projects that had some problems; it is projected upward to cover all the projects that were studied.\n\nFrom the audit, the numbers show that in 100% of the cases there were no background checks done on what kind of money these people might have owed to the government. There are some other disturbing numbers too. In 87% of the cases there was no overseeing or supervision of how the money was spent. In 80% of the cases there was no financial checking. These numbers are so massive they cannot be exaggerated. One cannot exaggerate 100%.\n\nCanadians need to know that the government not only is not acknowledging the scope of the problem, it is actually misleading them by trying to minimize it, by trying to bring those numbers down.\n\nThe minister has said she brought this forward because she wanted to be transparent. Let us look at the facts. The audit was done last summer. It is inconceivable that numbers like this, numbers in the 80%, 90% and 100% range, would not have rung alarm bells through the department right up to the minister's desk and the Prime Minister's office.\n\nIf that was not the case then clearly the government is not in charge. It does not know what is going on. It is in the dark. It really is not in charge of our affairs because it does not know of massive problems. That is inconceivable. That is unbelievable. That explanation insults the intelligence of Canadians.\n\nThe elected people who are in charge of these affairs did know and they chose to hide that in the House. Here are some quotes from the House.\n\nAfter he was elected, the Prime Minister said on June 16, 1994, “There can be no substitute for responsibility at the top. I vow to you, to this House, to Canadians, that I will never abdicate that responsibility. I will never pass the buck”. What did he do? This is what he is saying when these scandalous numbers come out, “I didn't know”.\n\nThen the former minister who is now the Minister for International Trade said on October 9, 1997 when there were allegations that there was an exchange of grants for contributions to the Liberal Party, “They have been approved by the department and are based on merit all the time, so much so that after I called the police in I asked my deputy minister, Mel Cappe, to review the whole process in which my department was proceeding”. This was in 1997. We were assured that everything was under review and everything was under control, no problem.\n\nThen the present minister on November 4, 1999 said, “Mr. Speaker, let us be clear here. The appropriate approval process was undertaken in this regard. The department did the due diligence on the opportunities. The stakeholders reviewed the information and recommended investment. No moneys flowed until the approval process was complete”. This is when the government knew there were massive problems that could not even be exaggerated if one wanted to because the numbers are so bad.\n\nWe have to tell Canadians the truth about this matter. We need to do it clearly and they have to have the facts. I would say to Canadians listening to this that they need to make a judgment based on the facts. The facts are in the audit. The facts are as I have quoted. The facts were covered up.\n\nMy party requested this audit on January 17 when we found out about it and guess what happened two days later. The minister stepped forward two days later and said, “Because I want to be transparent, I am releasing this audit that was done last summer that I have known about for months because I am so honest and transparent”. She was hiding the fact that she knew very well that the truth was going to come out because we were going to get the facts and we were going to make them public if she did not.\n\nThis is unacceptable. Canadians have a right to expect that their money is going to be properly managed. They have a right to expect that there will be no hiding of the truth, no minimizing of the truth, that the government will step forward, be candid with them, have full disclosure and deal with the problem in an appropriate manner. That is not happening.\n\nCanadians should be watching this debate. They should get the facts and they should make a judgment about the competence and trustworthiness of this government in managing their money, Canadians' money, and that is the fact we must never forget.\n\nI move:\n\nThat the motion be amended by inserting after the words “express its” the word “deep”.",

I believe the one billion dollars lost in the departmental boondoggle, money belonging to the workers and to the unemployed who also made contributions, is too much.\n\nYesterday, during oral question period, many members of all opposition parties called for the minister to resign. It is my personal conviction that the Prime Minister will continue to refuse the resignation of the present minister because he knows the responsibility is not all hers, that the former Minister of Human Resources Development, the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, is also responsible.\n\nThe Prime Minister will not be able to call for the two of them to resign either because, as we saw on television, he trivialized the matter, saying that it was nothing serious, an administrative error, something that happens fairly often. He treated it as if it were just a few crumbs under the table.\n\nWould my colleague agree to acknowledge that the primary responsibility lies with the former Minister of Human Resources Development, now the Minister of International Trade, and that the present Minister of Human Resources Development inherited this mess?

Officials from my department reviewed these project applications as they do with much diligence. They review all projects the same way. They recommended them for approval after they met all standard eligibility criteria”.\n\nClearly this was not the case. The former minister knew or ought to have known this, misled the House and also handed over this huge mess to his successor. His successor unfortunately had the same course of dealings, denying the problem, covering up the problem, refusing to be candid when questions were asked in the House and letting the mess continue until the whistle was blown by the opposition.\n\nClearly there have been two inept ministers appointed by this Prime Minister. They have been in charge of the largest spending department of this government. This department spends $60 billion of our money every year. A billion dollars is a thousand million dollars. These are huge amounts of money. We have a right to expect competence, believability and trustworthiness in the ministers the Prime Minister puts forward. He has failed us on every count.

Members opposite will of course have their fun heckling.\n\nThe first fact was used by the member for Calgary—Nose Hill when she recently said that “the government ordered the audit”. That is interesting; the government ordered the audit.\n\nI serve as vice-chair of the public accounts committee which is chaired by a member of the opposition. The public accounts committee hears from the auditor all the time. Every week he and his staff come in. They talk to us about areas they have audited which were not ordered by the government for which the agenda was set either by the public accounts committee or by the auditor himself. The important thing to establish is that the auditor is independent. Every member in the House must agree with that. The auditor is totally independent of any political interference whatsoever.\n\nThe integrity of the auditor of the government of this country is second to none. Anyone who knows him and his staff knows they are dedicated, fair and extremely thorough. They will go through programs, whether requested by a committee, the government, a minister or on their own, in such minute detail that some of the things they find out are truly quite amazing. Guess what happens. From time to time regardless of what party is in power around here, the auditor comes up with some problems. That is what he is there for. That is what the whole system is about.\n\nThe member for Calgary—Nose Hill stands in her place and says the government ordered the audit.\n\nI spoke to a group of young people yesterday, high school students who were touring our precinct. They were quite astounded when I gave them the facts because what they had read about this supposed boondoggle were headlines screaming “A billion dollar boondoggle”. I explained to them, and they are obviously more intelligent than some of my hon. colleagues opposite, that the actual program is a job creation program. It takes $1 billion and funnels it out into community groups from sea to sea to sea to create jobs for young people, to supplement wages for small businesses, to assist in hiring people, to deal with people who need training, to deal with people with disabilities, to help aboriginal Canadians with a hand up to get jobs, training and skills so they can get on with becoming participants in our society and to develop partnerships with community groups. That is what this program is all about. Members know this.\n\nThe real danger here in the misrepresentation that has gone on, is it continues to go on simply for one reason and that is that the opposition smells blood and indeed all of us know that this is a blood sport. We have to be tough and we have to stand up and defend and make them accountable because being in opposition they can say whatever they want.\n\nWe know about the Reform Party's accountability. We know that the Reform Party fires caucus members faster than Brian Mulroney changed his Gucci's. We know that if there is one person out of line or out of sync in the Reform Party, even the venerable House leader, he is simply booted out of caucus by the leader who stands in front of Canadians and purports to say they have a new way of doing business.\n\nThe Reform Party kicks people out of caucus faster than it takes to change the name from the united alternative to CCRAP. I should not say it because children may be watching. We all know what the acronym is. The Reform Party kicks people out of caucus faster than it takes to change the acronym from CCRAP to some other one.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that the party is struggling in that regard. The point is that Reform Party members talk about accountability and telling Canadian people the truth and putting forward issues of concern.\n\nI want to stress this point. We are talking about an entire project of $1 billion. The audit was done on 459 individual projects within the $1 billion program representing a total of $200 million. One-fifth of the HRD job creation program was audited. Out of that one-fifth, 37 files were identified as having problems. Those problems ranged from as small as not putting all the paperwork in the right order to as serious as not having the proper documentation at all. This is not acceptable to the government and it is certainly not acceptable to the minister.\n\nThe minister came forward and indicated that an audit had been done and she provided us with the results. She gave us the six point plan that will be put in place to deal with the mistakes. I do not think any Canadian would expect an organization the size of HRD or indeed the entire government to be without its share of problems. But to suggest that because an auditor requested to come in by the Government of Canada has identified some problems in the files and that a cabinet minister needs to step aside over that is political hysteria.\n\nMembers know full well that they are churning the pot and feeding the hysteria through the media. The only thing that would make their day a success would be to force a cabinet minister as dedicated and as hardworking as this one to resign from the job because of some trumped up nonsense.\n\nThat is not to say the government does not recognize there are problems. The government asked for the audit in the first place. I do not know how many times we have to say that. The minister released it. The opposition would take credit for that saying “She heard we were going to ask for it”. Excuse me, I am under the impression it was on the Internet. We do not get much more public than that. The minister came out with it and said “Here is the result of the audit. Here are the problems we have identified and here is the action plan that we will put in place to fix it”.\n\nWhat really bothers me about all of the hysteria by the members opposite and frankly by the media is that the real victims in all of this will be the community groups in British Columbia, in Newfoundland or in Ontario. They will be young people who need summer jobs. That is what this is about.\n\nI say to hon. members to put themselves in the position of a bureaucrat sitting down somewhere in Halifax, Mississauga or Vancouver with an application before them while all of this is going on in the media. Might one not just be a little nervous?\n\nThe Reform Party is the party that demands less red tape. In fact we will potentially see more red tape and more concern.\n\nWe want to have rules in place that the bureaucrats must follow. There must be financial accountability. The minister has said that she has put forward the plan that will do that, but we will drive wedges between the offices of HRDC.\n\nI would ask any of these members, some of them I am sure have but I know many of them have not, to go to the HRDC office and look at who is there. There are single moms looking to get retraining in computers. There are 45 to 55 year old men who have been displaced in their jobs and are looking to find a new career, a new alternative. They need our help and why should we not help them? If we can help them with a grant that creates a job, then they have a job and they will pay taxes and they will become productive, proud members of society.\n\nThe risk here in all seriousness is that we will damage the relationship our dedicated HRDC offices have. I have one in my community on Glen Erin Drive that services Peel and Halton. We will risk the relationship those offices have with the community.\n\nThere is an organization in Mississauga called the Centre for Education and Training. It does tremendous work. It would access funds through the HRDC office to provide training, retraining and motivation. It provides job skills and job search skills. It helps people develop resumes. It helps people get back on their feet.\n\nThe problem we face is that we tend to be in such a strong economic climate. Unemployment is at the lowest rate it has been since the 1970s for all levels. Whether it is for women, for youth, or for the entire sector of society, the unemployment rate is at its lowest for all levels. Interest rates are low. Inflation is virtually non-existent. The economy is humming. The books are balanced. We are in a surplus and are awaiting a budget at the end of February that I believe will deliver tax cuts to Canadians. Yet people are sitting around saying that there has to be something wrong here, it cannot be all that good and they will not sit back and accept all this prosperity. We have too many problems.\n\nPeople say we do not do anything for the homeless. Our minister went to Toronto and announced $743 million in partnership with the municipalities, provinces and the private sector. They should be able to leverage that $743 million into a couple of billion to create housing and help people get off the streets. Is it enough? I guess not. Maybe we would like to do more. I am sure many of us would. The government is trying to respond.\n\nWhat we see is a feeding frenzy of mass hysteria that is absolutely unfair to the Canadian people, who, because they have read the headlines, think that somehow we have lost a billion dollars. We have not lost one cent. They know that. What has been potentially lost is the faith and the confidence that the community groups have in working with HRD.\n\nMeet the men and women who deal in this business. Meet the Ray Fernbacks of this world, a dedicated civil servant who wants to help young people, people who are without jobs and people who are without hope. There are people like him all across this country. Simply because of the hysteria and the nonsense we are in danger of losing people like him and losing the relationship.\n\nOpposition members know full well that many of the job fund programs have gone into their ridings. The hypocrisy of being in the House and listening as they wax on is terrible. Let us read what they have actually said.\n\nThe member for Dauphin—Swan River said: “I am writing to express my support for the TJF application made by the Rolling River First Nation”. The member for Selkirk—Interlake said: “I strongly recommend that the TJF provide funding for this excellent creation program”. The member for Vancouver Island North said: “This is a great opportunity for creating new jobs and new wealth in the Comox Valley”. The member for Battlefords—Lloydminister said in a letter to the minister: “I would like to ask that you seriously consider the request for funding and give the Voice of the Blue Rose Advocacy a favourable response”. The member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, regarding an organization called “Loaves and Fishes”, said: “I would like to request that any and all avenues of financial resources be considered in assisting this important work to continue. I fully support the TJF application put forth by Tough Duck”. It is interesting that these are all Reformers.\n\nWhat this is really about is that the Reform Party wants to kill this program. The Reform Party thinks it is more important to give tax cuts to the rich than it is to help those small community organizations. It will not be tough duck; it will be tough luck. That is what will happen if the Reform Party has its way and runs its scalpel through the human resources development ministry. It will slash, burn and destroy programs.\n\nSome of these names might seem funny, but these are community organizations that are working in the community. The money goes to hire people to help them deliver the programs. We should not laugh. Reform Party members, of all people, should not laugh at funny names. Goodness knows, they have so many up their sleeves that we never know what they are going to come out with. That is the real agenda.\n\nThe member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, one of the few in the Reform Party whom I respect, said: “I believe that it is a worthy, viable and visionary undertaking which warrants your consideration and ultimately your approval of the applications”. Another quality member in this place, the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, said: “I hope that the money will be forthcoming from the transitional jobs fund to bolster the economy of Port Renfrew. My hope also is that other projects will be considered in the future that will provide for job training opportunities that are sustainable over the long term”.\n\nThere are some real mixed messages.\n\nThirty-seven projects have been identified. Interestingly enough, out of those 37, which represent $30 million—not $200 million, not $1 billion, but $30 million—which is still a lot of money—three of those projects have already been investigated. The files have been put in order and no further action is required by the ministry staff. Those three projects represent almost $12 million of the $30 million, which is almost half. Certainly over one-third of the entire area which was identified has already been dealt with, cleaned up and put to bed. The recommendation is that no further action need take place.\n\nThe rest of the investigations are ongoing. We can rest assured that in every HRDC office in the country people probably spent a fairly busy weekend going through the files, and so it should be. Because we refuse to buckle to the nonsensical demands of the opposition does not mean that the government, the minister and the prime minister do not take this seriously. This is serious stuff. When the auditor says “We have identified problems”, any government had better react.\n\nIn fairness, why not allow for a reasonable length of time for the government to do the work to clean up the mess? If there are not changes put in place, then perhaps the opposition's demands would make sense. If the government does not correct the problems that are there, whether they are systemic or they happen once, it has to investigate these things because Canadians expect no less than that kind of accountability, openness and transparency, that kind of serious effort by their government. Frankly, that is what is going to happen.\n\nIt is not just the Reformers. I will share with the House what the Conservative member for New Brunswick Southwest said: “It would not be fair to suggest that party affiliations play a role in the awarding of money”. I agree. They got over half the projects. He went on to say: “The resulting employment during construction and the permanent jobs to be created from the project will greatly benefit the people and the economy of the St. Stephen area”.\n\nWe all know the importance and the significance of this job creation fund. We know what it means to our youth, to our women, to our aboriginals, to our people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. We know the importance of the partnerships and the relationships that occur right across the land, and we have the serious potential of doing damage to programs that are fundamentally important to all Canadians.\n\nI will reject this motion, as will my colleagues. It is unworthy of the opposition.",

When we told the minister that not even 42% qualified to draw what they had paid in insurance and the minister gave us any old answer, was his answer based on actual figures or on what his officials were telling him? Did he manage his officials? Did he look into his department's internal administration? No. Because his only talent was an ability to denigrate the Quebecers who elected him. He became the Prime Minister's accomplice in manhandling Quebecers, as we called it in Quebec.

I think he has the toughest job in the country, trying to gloss over what absolutely has to be the worst public relations disaster imaginable. I admire that he has the courage to stand there and spout that kind of thing.\n\nIt was gracious of him to concede that there is definitely a problem with the administration of the programs. What he failed to comment on is that there is a huge problem in the allocation of the programs and who gets the benefits from the particular funds. The transitional jobs fund is the one that most comes to mind.\n\nStatistically I have the third poorest riding in the country. Does the hon. member know how many transitional jobs funds grants we got in our riding? I can tell him. None. Zero, not one red cent, because we were told we did not qualify. With an incidence of poverty of 32% or 33% in the whole riding we did not qualify because of some magic formula that they cooked up so they could allocate it all to their own ridings.\n\nThe riding of Edmonton West is where most of the country goes to get a job because there is so much prosperity there. The Minister of Justice is pulling in transitional jobs fund grants: $1.3 million to band trees to prevent Dutch elm disease. There is a meaningful and significant project. We did not get any, not one red cent.\n\nRegarding the administration of the fund, would the member agree that one of the biggest problems is that one cannot hack, cut and slash 30% of the public service and still expect to get the same amount of work done?

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's debate. I intend to be as non-partisan as possible. I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development since 1994. I have been working with that committee for several years and a number of issues have been referred to us.\n\nLet me read you today's motion from the Reform Party:\n\nThat this House express its concern over the gross mismanagement of more than one billion annually in grants and contributions from the Department of Human Resources Development, its support for the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, and its lack of confidence in the Minister of Human Resources Development.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois will support that motion.\n\nWhy do we find ourselves in that situation? In early January 2000, the current Minister of Human Resources Development—who, unlike the Prime Minister, did not consider this issue to be a minor problem involving only 37 cases—released an internal audit report which told Quebecers and Canadians that “there is a serious problem in the Department of Human Resources Development. The department has lost control over at least $1 billion. An internal audit investigation was conducted”.\n\nIt is important that people know what an internal audit is all about. It is really a sampling. In this case, 459 files were pulled out and reviewed. We were told that they took 459 files out of 30,000 in the department. So, it is a very small sample. Out of these 459 files, 37 were found to be very serious cases involving some $30 million.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister tells us that the present situation is not serious, that only 37 projects are problematic, he is abusing statistical science and misrepresenting how internal audits are done. I urge the Prime Minister to find out from chartered accountants what such an internal audit means. It is a test done to check whether in fact a department or a company is operating properly.\n\nWhen a certain number of cases are unacceptable, a red light goes off. This is what the Minister of Human Resources Development made public on January 17.\n\nWhat we now have is the government trying—and the remarks by the member who preceded me were irresponsible—to tell us that in the whole of the department there were 37 problematic projects, when the number of projects audited was 459 out of a total of 30,000. Statistically speaking, these 37 projects represent almost 2,400 problematic cases. This could involve nearly $2 billion.\n\nThat is the fact of the matter and that is what the motion before us is critical of. If the federal government, because of the position taken by the Prime Minister, says there are only 37 cases, it is being completely irresponsible. We see the result. The result is that the parties opposed to job creation programs are saying that such programs are no good. In an attempt to get itself out of hot water, the government is accusing the Reform Party of wanting to kill these programs.\n\nThe problem we are now facing is not the relevance of job creation programs but the Liberal government's management of them. In so doing, the Liberal government ends up negating the effectiveness of the job creation programs, and that is very serious.\n\nAs for the scandal itself, what the internal audit showed up, let us recall that, out of the 459 files examined, 15% contained no application from the promoters. This means that, in 15 of every 100 projects, the project promoter could not be identified.\n\nIn 72% of the remaining applications there were no forecasts; in 46% there was no anticipated number of participants; in 25% there was no description of the activities to be supported.\n\nAnd so it goes on. Most impressive. If something like this happened in a small five-employee business in the private sector, the boss would call operations to a halt and say “Everybody into my office. We are going to see what is going on. This makes no sense. We're in an awful mess here”. The fact is the business would likely have already closed, if it were in such a situation.\n\nThere are some other very important elements. For example, 97% of files bore no indication that the promoters had been checked for outstanding debts to HRDC. In 70% of project files, there was nothing about expenditures. In other words, 7 out of every 10 files contained no invoices or payslips to justify expenditures.",

            "text": "That is the right word for it. Scandalous it is.\n\nIn my opinion, the government had two responsibilities in a situation like this. It ought to have decided to lay all the cards on the table, which would have been the ideal situation, because we are faced with a rather peculiar situation here as far as parliamentary operations are concerned.\n\nThe present Minister of Human Resources Development, in that portfolio only since the summer of 1999, has some responsibility because she learned of the situation as early as last fall but waited until January to make it public, while parliament was not sitting, so as to keep things as quiet as possible.\n\nWe must remember her announcement was made at the same time the Minister of Industry was getting involved in hockey clubs. But between her announcement and the end of the hockey club saga, the Minister of Industry withdrew his proposal because of the hooha it raised from the public. So the grand announcement, which was meant to be hidden while parliament was not sitting and be kept as quiet as possible, moved into the limelight.\n\nWhy did it move as far into the limelight as it is today? Primarily because the public, who pays taxes and thinks it is already paying too much, did not like having its money wasted. The current Liberal government was getting hot under the collar about Emploi-Québec, which had just been set up, was beginning to operate and was established to make a success of providing proper manpower services.\n\nWe even heard the Prime Minister say, when I was in Hull as an observer at the Liberal convention, “My God, that is really embarrassing for us Quebecers”. At the same time, his department, which had been in operation for several years, is unable to account for a billion dollars. The department is faced with a situation where the number of scandalous cases uncovered by the internal audit is such that as much as $2 billion may have disappeared through programs, with no one knowing where the money went.\n\nThis is why taxpayers find this unacceptable. No one in Canada is buying the Prime Minister's claim that there are only 37 cases. Indeed, we all know that we are talking about an internal audit involving only a small sampling of overall government operations. It is important to realize that. We are stressing that point because we know people will understand it. We must take what was said and go to the bottom of the issue if we can get all the information.\n\nThis week, at the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, we will be asking that not only the current Minister of Human Resources Development but also her predecessor appear before the committee to tell us about the period targeted by the internal audit, that is from April 1997 to June 1998, when the current minister's predecessor was in charge. He was the one responsible for that department at the time. That period also encompasses the election campaign. This is a good example of what this government attempted to do.\n\nYesterday morning, two rather uncomfortable deputy ministers gave a 90-munite briefing in the press lounge, to explain the status of those 37 cases. The government is acting in an irresponsible and petty way by trying to make public servants look like they are the culprits.\n\nLet us take the example of the transitional jobs creation fund. When officials in Quebec working for the Department of Human Resources Development meet with a sponsor, they open a file, complete it, have it approved at the regional, provincial and Canadian level and the minister signs.\n\nWhen a project operates this way, usually things go reasonably well, but what is now coming to light is that there is a group of projects that, instead of working their way from the bottom up, proceeded from the top down during the election period. Looking at the whole of Quebec, 54% of the projects approved in the three years between April 1996 and April 1999 received that approval in the months immediately before and after the election.\n\nThe scenario goes like this. The previous Minister of Human Resources Development who, during the election campaign, found himself being pressured, receiving telephone calls or visiting a business, told people not to worry and promised to see that things were sorted out after the election.\n\nAnd we are talking about an election campaign. During that period, they were not just spreading their favours in Liberal ridings; they also went after other ridings. Fortunately, however, Quebecers do not go for this sort of bait. They resisted the temptation.\n\nBut now we are looking at a group of projects that public servants inherited on June 10, July 1 and in August, for which the minister had given his word. The word went out that the minister had given his word and that now it was up to them to produce results. Now, two years later, an internal audit reveals that no sponsor was listed for 15% of the projects. No problem; they got their money anyway.\n\nIn 70% of the files, there was no financial monitoring. No problem, they got their money anyway. Today they are trying to tell us that this is not possible, that there were just the 37 cases. No way. They did not look at just 37 cases during the election campaign; it was way more than that.\n\nI believe that what we have here is a shocking scandal, because this was going on in the department that had launched an all-out an attack against the unemployed, one that has been going on for several years. On the one hand they were unable to manage employment programs, while on the other they knew very well what their objective for recovery was. Every Canada employment centre had an objective setting out how much had to be recovered from the unemployed.\n\nThey looked at eligibility in order to ensure that as few people as possible would be entitled to benefits. They organized things to ensure that as few as possible would receive benefits. They put on more employment insurance investigators while at the same time, at the other end of the system, there was no monitoring.\n\nAll in all, they were acting like a business and decided to focus only on increasing revenues. However, we are not dealing with a business here, but a department, the one responsible for the social function of the federal government of Canada. It is the department most responsible for sharing the wealth, and here it is being used to gain votes for the Liberal Party of Canada. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nIf that had been the only problem in the department, one might have said that there was a crisis relating to the management of those particular programs. However, over the course of the past four or five years, there was also a scandal over the use of social insurance numbers, because in Canada there were more people over the age of 100 than in the entire world with a social insurance number. It took an opinion from the auditor general; it took a unanimous report by the committee to call for a change in things, and the answer we kept getting from the predecessor of the current minister, the member for Papineau—St-Denis was “Everything is fine. There is no problem”.\n\nThat is in fact what this minister keeps saying. They have the same tape. I think the prime responsibility of the current Minister of Human Resources Development is to not have changed the machine; to have taken the recording of her predecessor and played it endlessly. I think she has a lot of responsibility in this respect.\n\nToday we learn—and this is another incredible example—that the youth employment strategy, which served as the weapon of the minister's predecessor, the member for Papineau—St-Denis, when he was Minister of Human Resources Development, who said “See how the Government of Canada does good things”, that 33% of the money allocated produced no results. This program did not create the jobs it was supposed to create. It has not brought young people back to work as it should have done, and it is in the hot seat, like the Canada jobs fund, like the youth employment strategy and like all the other programs that were evaluated.\n\nOne of the things that has been mentioned is literacy programs. Do members think that Canada can afford to waste money? Can it afford to squander literacy funding? I think that this funding is needed to do something about the problems of our illiterate citizens.\n\nBut if the money is improperly spent and the use to which it is put unknown, I think that the desired results have not been achieved. Perhaps what is most tragic about the whole affair, when all is said and done, is that there are people who need these programs, and we have argued in favour of programs to revitalize the economy in areas of high unemployment. We have never challenged the need for such programs.\n\nWhat can be challenged is when the minister directs funding to her riding for a program for which only ridings with unemployment rates of 10% and higher should qualify, when unemployment in her riding stands at 6%, and at the same time turns down funding for the Gaspé with its 22% unemployment rate. That is dishonest and unacceptable.\n\nHow did we get to this state of affairs? How did this situation come about?\n\nLet us go to the heart of the problem. There is a Prime Minister who appoints ministers. He is the one who appointed the incompetent individual who is now the Minister for International Trade. At least he pulled him out of a department which gives out a lot of money and assigned him to the part of the job he can handle, which is public relations. But appointing him Minister of Human Resources Development was an incompetent move.\n\nBy appointing the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis Minister of Human Resources Development, the Prime Minister showed his incompetence. He went for first impressions. The Prime Minister told himself “He will make a good spokesperson. He will repeat exactly what we want for the department. He will keep saying for years that everything is fine and then, when things get too hot, when I know the results, I will move him elsewhere”.\n\nThe Prime Minister then appointed the current Minister of Human Resources Development. During the period that she has been in charge, there has been no concrete information on the situation in her department. It was only in January 2000 that she said she inherited a department that was coming out of the middle ages. The middle ages are a dark period of our history, a period when civilization did not exist, a period when people did not know how to make things work. But patronage was thriving then. This is the period to which the current minister is referring when she talks about her predecessor, the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis. He was the one in charge during that dark period, during the middle ages.\n\nAs my colleague says, we were also able to see—with the figures provided by the Bloc Quebecois on the impact of the election campaign—that this was not only a dark and black period, but very much a red period as well.\n\nWe are trying to find out who is responsible for this situation. We mentioned that the Prime Minister appointed someone who was not competent for the job, but who remained in charge of the department for several years. Then, the Prime Minister appointed another minister. We did give that minister a chance, did we not? Just last week, the Bloc Quebecois was saying “We need all the information. We will not ask for heads to roll. We will not ask for people to resign, but we will ask questions in the House”.\n\nYesterday I did ask a question to the minister. I asked her why, between December 1 and December 16, 1999, she continued to defend the programs here in this House, whereas she had been aware of the audit since November 17, 1999. I was expecting an honest answer, one that would say “I became aware of it and in fact—”, with an attempt to find an intelligent answer. But no, off she went again with the same old tape from the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, the one that says that everything is fine, even if the place is burning down. The old story of “Don't worry, be happy”.\n\nThe present minister continued along the same lines, which is why I find that the motion of the Reform Party is in order. When they refer to their “lack of confidence in the Minister of Human Resources Development”, it is because she is the one who took on the burden of the situation created by her predecessor.\n\nHad she been responsible, she would have said right from the time that the situation became known, “I am going to encourage my predecessor to come and testify; I am going to ask Mel Cappe, the deputy minister responsible for the entire Government of Canada, the top civil servant, to come and testify”. He was, after all, the deputy minister of the department the whole time that this was going on, during this whole scandal.\n\nThis is one more example of the responsibility of the Prime Minister of Canada. After appointing the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis as Minister of Human Resources Development and then, after he proved incompetent, the present minister, who is incapable of taking on her responsibilities, he also appointed Mel Cappe to the highest position in the public service. Now we know that the Government of Canada is, at the top deputy ministerial level, being managed by a person who has created a scandal in all of Canada's social programs. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nThus, the primary responsibility for all this lies with the Prime Minister of Canada. He appointed successive ministers incapable of doing their job; he took advantage of their inconsistency to create the transitional jobs fund in order to get himself and his Liberal colleagues re-elected. He tried to dump all the responsibility onto the public servants. This whole attitude of disregard for democracy, which means making things known so that there may be transparency in order to allow people to make the proper choices, leads us to vote in favour of the motion. The primary responsibility for this scandal lies with the present Prime Minister of Canada.",

There is a proof of guilt, we are sure the person is guilty, but someone—not just anyone, the Prime Minister of Canada himself—is telling us that an internal audit has shown problems in 37 cases out of 459. He claims that only 37 cases are problematic, and the rest does not exist.\n\nHe denies the fact that this department handled 30,000 cases. hope the auditor general puts these facts on the table next fall. He will be asked to appear before the committee so that we can look specifically into this matter. My assumption is that, once our review is over, these 37 cases out of 459 will not look like a little sore but rather as the sign of a growing cancer within the department, a cancer which has been tolerated by the present government, which wanted it and took advantage of it in the 1997 election.\n\nIn this sense, the member is perfectly right.

It was moved to the Prime Minister's riding—such a coincidence—where there was no unemployment office. We used to have about ten offices, and their number had to go down to just two. They closed down all of them and opened two, one in Montreal and the other one in the Prime Minister's riding. Of all the ridings in Quebec, guess where they got the best percentage during the election? Something tells me it is in the Prime Minister's riding.\n\nMy colleague is absolutely right.

It is true that hon. members stopped being consulted during the election campaign. That is part of what we could bring up if we are ever allowed to have some light shed on this issue.\n\nWe could check if discretionary choices were purely partisan choices. There were two ways to go about this. On the one hand, there were the summer careers placements program and other programs. On the other, contributions were coming in.\n\nLast year, we had a good indication of the way things were going. Members probably remember the Corbeil case. Supposedly, that meant nothing. HRDC was as pure as the driven snow. Corbeil was found guilty, but that did not trigger any alarms and nothing changed in the government's ways. It took an internal audit which the minister was made aware of on November 17 and which she made public in January for the government to start dealing with the issue.\n\nThere is a fundamental problem with this government, and that is the Prime Minister's style of politics. Throughout his political career, the Prime Minister has been known to resort to partisanship, to show contempt and to disregard democratic principles and the will of the people.\n\nI will speak to the Prime Minister in terms that he will understand. If he sees the Government of Canada as his business and his business alone, I remind him that the shareholders of his government are the citizens of Canada.

This is a period when the federal government has money.\n\nIn the past, it had developed a habit of wasting money and creating deficits. Now that fiscal balance has been achieved, the government is back at it again. However, the internal audit that was conducted revealed a deep and serious problem. We absolutely must shed light on the whole situation at the Department of Human Resources Development and also see what is going on in the other departments.\n\nLast week, a deputy minister from Treasury Board wrote a memo to all the departments that give grants and subsidies. He said “Are you sure that what is going on in Human Resources Development Canada is not also going on in your department?” You can be sure that we will get to the bottom of this and see to it that the Prime Minister takes full responsibility.",

Otherwise, we would not be fully doing our duty as parliamentarians if we did not get to the bottom of the issue and allow all Canadians to see the whole truth.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, as the spokesperson for the federal New Democrats on Human Resources Development Canada, I am very pleased to speak to this opposition day motion.\n\nNew Democrats concur and support the motion because we believe it gets to the issue that we have been debating and it certainly expresses our concern about the gross mismanagement of more than $1 billion annually in grants and contributions by the Department of Human Resources Development, as the motion outlines.\n\nThe motion and the issue that we are debating today gets to the core of something that is very important in our democracy and in our system of governance, the issue of ministerial responsibility.\n\nAfter looking at the information that has come to light over the last several weeks about the internal audit of HRDC, it is clear that this is an issue on the proper management of public funds. This is an issue on the integrity and credibility of the government. Even members of the government have admitted that the practices that have gone on in that department have been astounding and scandalous and, as the minister has said, she herself has called for further information.\n\nWhat is most disturbing about this issue is that the government itself is also in denial about what is really taking place. Yesterday in question period, and in other debates that have taken place, it has been very interesting to see the government now madly back-pedalling to defend its record and to defend what has happened. It is now switching tactics. It is now saying, as I heard today in the House from government members, that opposition members do not support job creation or job development, and that the government is now the big defender of job development in the country.\n\nThe government's second tactic is to attack opposition members on legitimate projects that were approved in various ridings through existing programs, with all the rules in place, with the proper application forms and so on. The government is now in denial and is trying to put up some smoke and mirrors to switch the line of attack.\n\nAs New Democrats, we have always supported legitimate and worthy job development programs. Many of us represent ridings in Canada that have high unemployment and high poverty. It was in fact our party that pushed the government to be more forthcoming in its support for job creation and helping the unemployed. Let us be very clear that the issue is not about whether a job development program is good. We are the first to say that job development programs and job creation are very critical in the country.\n\nCanadians are not fooled by the Liberal counteroffensive. They understand that at issue are the findings of the government's own audit which gave very clear evidence about the mismanagement of this fund. The issue is the absolute mismanagement of huge amounts of public funds and the partisan political decision making that is taking place.\n\nPartisan political decision making is the nicest way to say it. To be quite frank, it is also a slush fund. The concern has been that public funds have been used by the Liberal government, breaking its established criteria for the transitional jobs fund and other programs, and basically shovelling the money into its own ridings, which are not in need, when other areas are greatly in need. What is at issue is the management of the fund and how it has been administered in a very political and partisan way.\n\nWhat disturbs us as New Democrats is the complete lack of accountability, not only in the management of the fund and what has come from it but, now that this has been put on the table and the internal audit has become public, the lack of accountability in the government's response and the lack of accountability from the current minister and the previous minister.\n\nMr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Winnipeg Centre.\n\nIn our democracy, our parliamentary system, there is a very honourable tradition that when there has been a lack of accountability and mismanagement, at the end of the day it is the minister who must take responsibility. The minister is accountable and the government is responsible for decisions that have been made. That is why opposition parties have been very clear in telling the current minister and the previous minister that we want accountability.\n\nWe have a number of questions about this fund. Looking at the internal audit, we see that it was only a sample audit, not a full detailed audit. In reading the report, we read “there was concern with respect to some political presence in the programs at times. While a certain amount of political involvement is expected in a program involving partners from the various levels of government, there was nevertheless some uneasiness amongst some respondents regarding projects which may have been approved for political reasons rather than based on the strength of the business plan”.\n\nThe NDP has a huge amount of concern about the very diplomatic language that is being used in an audit that clearly points to the political decision making and political management that took place to the advantage of the government for their Liberal members and its party.\n\nWe have questions as to where those funds ended up. Why did they end up in the minister's riding, the Prime Minister's riding and other Liberal member ridings that clearly did not meet the criteria for the fund? Why did affluent ridings receive a disproportionate amount of these funds? They may have had some unemployment but certainly not as high as other parts of Canada, such as Vancouver East, the area that I represent. Look at the downtown eastside which has the lowest income postal code in Canada. There was one transitional jobs fund program approved in 1997, before I was a member of parliament. It is an area of incredibly high unemployment. Why has that area not received anything? Why has money gone into the member's riding? Why has it not gone into the riding of my colleague from Winnipeg Centre, which also has high unemployment?\n\nThere are some very serious questions about why a massive amount of public funds have been directed in such a way that they have clearly benefited government members and to the detriment of other needier areas in Canada.\n\nOur critic for EI, the member for Acadie—Bathurst, wrote a letter to the auditor general calling for an immediate special audit of the situation in HRDC. The letter he received back made it clear that the staff of the auditor general, who were conducting an audit into the grants and contributions, believed that there was so much work that needed to be done that the audit would not be completed until the end of July and the report published in October. It is important that the audit be done.\n\nMembers of the NDP support the motion because we believe it is very important to get to the bottom of what took place. We know that Canadians support legitimate, transparent and accountable job creation and job development programs.\n\nWe in the NDP have always supported those programs. What we do not support is the denial, the lack of accountability, and what is now obviously political management of the fund that is benefiting government members and denying areas most in need. Those are the questions that we want to see fully made transparent.\n\nIn conclusion, the motion deals with the issue of accountability and integrity of the government. We think that is very critical. At the end of the day the current minister and the former minister who are both involved in this matter must be responsible and must do the responsible thing in terms of being accountable for what has taken place within the department. We have called for their resignation and will continue to do that. We support the motion.",

The Liberals are like the Liberals of old, the do-gooders for their friends who stupidly believe that top down broad bureaucratic job creation programs actually create lasting economic transformation. The Liberals cannot manage. Especially starting in the Pearson-Trudeau years, federal ministers are inherently expansionary. They exist; therefore they will spend.\n\nWill the member vote against the socialism of the Liberals in the next budget? What we are looking at today was in last year's budget.

If he looks at the Government of Saskatchewan or the NDP Government of British Columbia, and if he looks at the work we do in the House, he will see that we take very seriously fiscal responsibility and ensuring that public funds mandated under specific programs go where they are needed.\n\nThis is why in terms of this issue we are scandalized and outraged at what has taken place under the Liberal administration.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Vancouver East for agreeing to share her time with me. As she has correctly pointed out in her speech, our two ridings share a great deal of common items, most of which are not very enviable. The very things we share are things people would probably not want to share. One of them is that both our ridings suffer from chronic long term poverty and all the predictable consequences that come with it.\n\nAs the member pointed out, she represents what is the poorest postal code region in the country, downtown Vancouver East. My riding is the third poorest riding in the country when measured by the incidence of poverty and average family income. However, the point I would like to make is that neither of us qualify for any transitional jobs fund money. Although we are suffering from crime, violence and all issues surrounding chronic long term poverty, we do not qualify for the help these funds were presumably set up to assist ridings in dire straits. Frankly there has not been one red cent for the riding of Winnipeg Centre.\n\nThat really irks us. It is galling, as we see the onion being peeled back layer by layer and the truth starting to come out, that the ridings benefiting from these funds are fairly affluent and well to do ridings. More often than not there has been some political influence in how these grants were allocated to various ridings.\n\nThe most glaring and best example we could use is the riding represented by the current minister of HRDC. With an unemployment rate of 6.6% and an incidence of poverty of 10.7% in her riding, how does she justify pouring job creation money into the particular riding? Most of us in poor inner city ridings look to statistics such as these and are envious of them.\n\nAnother glaring example came to light when we looked at the Edmonton East riding of the current Minister of Justice. Most of the country is flocking to Edmonton because there are jobs and opportunity and prosperity. I am not sure what the unemployment rate is in Edmonton West but I am sure it is not the 12% that we were told was necessary to qualify for these funds.\n\nA $1.3 million grant went to banding trees to prevent Dutch elm disease in the riding of Edmonton West. This is a laudable concept. I am all in favour of saving elm trees, but why do we not qualify for anything with an unemployment rate that is staggering in the inner city of Winnipeg and an incidence of poverty that is 31.1%? Some 31.1% of all people living in my riding are poor and we do not get anything, zero, zippo. We were told that we do not qualify.\n\nThe rules keep changing. First there had to be 12% unemployment to qualify. Now we learn that maybe in the riding of Edmonton West it is not under 12% but that there are pockets of unemployment. That is the term they are using. Aboriginal people in her riding are disproportionately unemployed. That is a legitimate point but she did not tell that to us.\n\nWe have the same argument in Vancouver East or Winnipeg Centre. I could point to and illustrate pockets of unemployment all over my riding, but we were told that we do not get anything. This is what is really galling and grating to people who are representing areas in genuine need.\n\nThe hon. member for Vancouver East pointed out two flaws in the current system. One is the glaring errors in the administration of the fund. That is really what came to light first. Nobody can deny there is a serious problem. Even the minister is recognizing that there is a serious problem. I can indicate why we have this serious problem. It is because when one-third of the public sector is cut, hacked and slashed and everybody is laid off, how could we expect the same amount of work to be done?\n\nIt is unreasonable to think the same kind of scrutiny can be applied to these projects when everybody has been fired. In the federal public sector 50,000 people have been laid off. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. We are starting to see the predictable outcome of laying off all those people.\n\nThe next glaring point about the TJF is the allocation. It was a mystery to all of us how some ridings got these grants and some did not. Now it seems pretty clear. It is political influence. The Liberals are using it as a Liberal slush fund to further their own interests in their own ridings.\n\nObviously on a personal level I can point out that it is tragic we did not get any of it in my riding, but the real tragedy is that it makes members of the general public even more cynical than they already were about the political process and about what we do in this place as politicians.\n\nIf they were not jaded enough already, as the real horror of this disastrous story unfolds more and more Canadians will be even more cynical about their government. That is the tragic point I would like to make. It is tough enough to do our job and try to maintain some semblance of dignity without this kind of thing tarnishing the image of every person who stands in the House of Commons.\n\nIn the Prime Minister's riding there were 17 of these TJF grants. Let us imagine the millions and millions and millions of dollars. Actually we have a total list of all grants that went into the riding of the Minister of Human Resource Development. Over three years there were $30 million in grants or $10 million a year. It is a booklet as thick as the Manhattan phone book. Virtually every little business in the whole riding has had something shovelled toward them from these many, many, many programs. Not all of them were TJF grants. I think there were only three transitional jobs fund grants in her riding, but in an area with 6.6% unemployment, not even half the minimum standard which the rules say have to be met before a riding qualifies for anything, it makes one wonder how that money was directed to that riding.\n\nMost of us on the prairies look to Ontario as a land of opportunity and prosperity. How do towns like Brant qualify for these grants? I am sure that there are problems all over the country and everybody deserves equal access to these types of training funds and subsidies, but it seems it is disproportionately going to areas that cannot really argue they need it.\n\nThe average family income in the riding represented by the Minister of Human Resources Development is $45,000 a year. The people in the core area of Winnipeg can only dream about aspiring to that level of income. The average family income where I live is $28,000 a year. We are talking about a disparity. It may just be a different standard of poverty, but it is certainly a lack of understanding of what it means to be locked into the inner city core area without opportunity. These programs should be there to assist on a broader level.\n\nWe talked about the Prime Minister's riding with 17 of these grants worth $7,296,000. Is this justifiable when other ridings are being given absolutely nothing?\n\nI echo the comments of my colleague that frankly the NDP is not against job creation programs. If the transitional jobs fund did not exist the NDP would probably be calling for such a program to be created. We are in favour of this kind of thing, but we make the argument that everybody should have equal access to those opportunities. They should not be spread out in as disproportionate a way as they are currently.\n\nIt really does make me wonder how the minister of HRDC with 6.6% unemployment can qualify for any kind of grant at all. Then of course there is Edmonton West with $1.3 million to band trees to prevent Dutch elm disease. There is a Dutch elm disease problem in Winnipeg too, but I do not think anybody would be so presumptuous as to apply for a transitional jobs fund grant for it.\n\nI close by saying that the NDP will be voting in favour of the Reform Party's opposition day motion. We think we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg here as has been pointed out over and over again. As we get deeper into this scandal, and that is the only word we can use as it is going to be the scandal of the spring, I regret as well that we are being diverted from the many other pressing issues of the day. Frankly, it is a bit of a diversion that we are concentrating on this subject instead of all the important work that we could be doing, but it is necessary. To restore the confidence of the general public it is a process we are going to have to go through as painful as it is.\n\nThe real tragedy is not seeing one minister toppled, if that is to be. The real tragedy is that the general public is so disillusioned as they watch this unfold that we are doing permanent damage to the reputation of the whole political system. This should be dealt with swiftly. If the government were honourable it would not be dallying around. It would not be trying to build barricades and fences around the issue. It should treat this issue honestly and admit that something terrible is taking place. A very transparent process must take place to heal the wounds because some cuts do not heal.",

Even in the opinion of the Prime Minister, it hearkens back to the great Mulroney years. The Prime Minister got carried away last week saying that things were no worse than they had been in Brian Mulroney's time.\n\nI think they are worse. Here, a deliberate effort is being made to play with democracy. For example, in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the week before the election on June 2, 1997, there was an avalanche of often questionable grants, including to the golf club and to a certain motel the Prime Minister is quite familiar with.\n\nIn Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, my friend and former colleague, Roger Pomerleau, was beaten by my former union head. Thanks to the abuse, his election cost taxpayers $25 million.\n\nIn the riding of Brant, where there is almost no unemployment, millions and millions of dollars were invested in mismanaged programs.\n\nAccording to the polls, as they put it so well, if the trend continues, we have taken at random 459 files, which we have systematically studied and have come up with 37 nebulous cases, really nebulous.\n\nThere is no need for me to mention Vidéotron, McGill or the natives who repaid jewels with taxpayers' money. Off the top of my head, this represents an 8% rate of error in the administration of HRDC.\n\nIf there are in fact 10,000 files, at the rate of 8% there would be 800 cases, and 37 have been found. There are another 763 they will have to start looking for tomorrow morning.\n\nI do not understand. I wrote a letter to the former Minister of Human Resources Development because, through his delivery assistance program, an arbitrary decision, he had allocated a certain questionable amount in my riding. I wrote him saying “Be careful, Mr. Minister. You are playing with public money. You are cutting the benefits of the unemployed and using the money to pad those who do not need padding. They are already well padded financially”.\n\nThree months later—he often went to Paris too often, apparently —he wrote me to say “I do not understand, Mr. Chrétien, your not being proud at having $35,000 distributed in your riding”.\n\nI am happy to have him give $35,000, but properly.",

This is a quote from the Prime Minister in 1991. He said, “When we form the government every minister in the cabinet that I will be presiding over will have to take full responsibility for what is going on in his department. If there is any bungling in the department, no one will be singled out. It will be the minister that will have to take the full responsibility”. Those are very strong words and it was a zero tolerance attitude maintained by the current Prime Minister as the opposition leader in 1991.\n\nWe would like to see the same sort of swift action, take no prisoners. If we are going to restore the public's confidence, swift action must be taken. Frankly the minister is going to have to go. We are going to hold the current Prime Minister to his word and the comments he made in 1991. The same should still apply today.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.\n\nThe saga continues. Let us go back in time. We have heard different members get up in the House of Commons today and speak about whatever we want to call it, shovelgate, or Place du Portage gate, which is the building which houses this department, or the bunker. We could name it what we want but it is certainly a huge scandal.\n\nLet us go back to January 19 when the minister of HRDC came into the foyer of the House of Commons and delivered the internal audit dated January 2000. That very same day I called the department for a copy of the audit and it was so kind as to send a copy to my office. Then 10 minutes later I got a phone call from the same department to tell me that I had been sent the wrong cover sheet and I was asked if I would destroy that cover sheet and throw it in the garbage. I asked to be sent the other cover sheet and I would take a look at it. When I received the other cover sheet, there was no date. The date of October 5 had been deleted. I checked with the various media to see what cover sheet they had received and they had received the one with no date.\n\nIt is obvious from that that the department was in a massive cover-up. It might be a strong word but it is certainly a lot of money. We are talking about a billion dollars here, not a million. We are talking about a billion dollars of taxpayers' money, money that people work hard for every single day, and they pay hard taxes as well. We have come to find that a billion dollars has possibly been mismanaged. I think it has been mismanaged.\n\nWe are looking at 459 cases out of 30,000 cases and 37 could be very serious. Let us do the math. The math was done to do the audit. They picked 459 different cases. If we do the math and take 37 cases out of 459 out of a universe of 30,000, that would give us 2,400 files with a problem for a possible total of $2 billion.\n\nTwo billion dollars is a lot of money and we are only talking about one department, HRDC. Out of this big universe in Ottawa, HRDC is not the only department that gives out grant money. There is Heritage Canada and industry. There is a serious problem.\n\nWe have been asking for an external audit on this. The minister sent out to the press conference yesterday the very same people she accused of being in the dark ages just the week before. I have questions for the House and the minister. Who is in charge of the department? Is it the senior bureaucrats we saw yesterday or is it the minister? We all saw the scrum coming out of the PMO last week. We have good reason to think why she was not there.\n\nWe also asked yesterday for the resignation of the minister because the buck stops there. The buck stops with her desk, not with anybody else. She accused bureaucrats of bungling this. I state in the House of Commons that when I deal with the bureaucrats in my riding, they are very thorough and very transparent. If she is going to point the finger at somebody, she had better put a mirror in front of herself and point at it. That is the person she has to blame.\n\nWe also find with this audit that there was a concentration of grants given during the 1997 electoral period, 54% to be exact. That can be put in the calculator too. Fifty-four per cent of the grants were given during an election period. It is absolutely scandalous that taxpayers' money that was supposed to go into regions affected by employment insurance reform was being used to try to elect Liberal members.",

We will tell them the facts and let them decide what is really going on.\n\nThese programs were brought in to help regions with high levels of unemployment, regions which under TJF had to have 12% and higher, like my riding. I was fortunate enough to receive TJF funds and the funds worked well. But mishandlings went on in the department and that is the problem. We have to find out exactly what is going on with the department so we can maximize the impact of what this was supposed to do in helping the regions.\n\nThe minister's own riding of Brant has an unemployment level of 6.6%. Where is the justification for qualifying projects in that riding? If my riding had 6.6%, we would not have received a cent, but it has something like 25% to 30%.\n\nThe bureaucrats yesterday, when being questioned by the media, stated that there are pockets of unemployment within that riding. We have a hard time getting the unemployment rate in a riding. How can we get a reading of the unemployment rate in a pocket of a riding? In my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, the Restigouche portion is calculated with the area of Charlotte in southern New Brunswick. How can we calculate a pocket within a riding? Is it by street number? I am not sure, but I would certainly like to see how it is done. I would like to see the pocket in my riding which is the highest.\n\nWe are very concerned with what has gone on in the past couple of weeks, and probably the past couple of years. We are talking about $1 billion, maybe a lot more. We could call it shovelgate, or whatever we want, but it is the biggest scandal in Canadian history and it is on the Liberal government's head. The only way we can get around this, the only way we can bring transparency back to this parliament, is to ask for an external audit. We cannot ask the very same department to audit what it has done. That is like asking the RCMP to investigate the RCMP. We cannot do that.\n\nWe have a responsibility as a parliament to the people of Canada to be transparent. Therefore, I ask the minister to call for an external audit to get to the bottom of this.\n\nI want to congratulate my colleague for putting forward this motion.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate. As alluded to by my colleague, the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche, it is very timely that the official opposition brought forward this motion.\n\nAs time passes it is like the dance of a thousand veils that we are seeing from the government. We are seeing more and more information coming forward. I would suggest this is not coming forward in a very voluntary and forthright way, as members of the government would have us believe. In fact, the minister literally had the proverbial gun to her head when she knew that access to information requests had been made and that this information was inevitably going to be made public.\n\nLet us start with the premise that the HRDC ministry is set up for a very legitimate purpose. There are areas in the country which obviously need assistance in job creation. As the hon. member opposite suggested, we are not, as an opposition, suggesting that every single program in the country was somehow not legitimate. We are suggesting that it is coming to light daily that a significant portion of them were not legitimate. It is absolutely astonishing when we hear, and when the Canadian public hears, that there are companies which received money that did not even fill out an application. It is absolutely astronomical when one considers the implications.\n\nHow did the money get from the government coffers into the hands of an organization that apparently did not even request it?\n\nI believe the most appropriate characterization of all of this is mismanagement. I would suggest that the minister has been very economical with the truth when it comes to the disclosure of information. She has suggested in numerous statements that HRDC knows where the money is, that it is all accounted for. We can go to our bank accounts and see that withdrawals were made. We have the cheques to suggest that the money was received. The question is: How was the money spent? Was it spent in line and consistent with the applications, if there were applications? Was the money accounted for? Was it tracked? Was there any mechanism or system in place which guaranteed the legitimacy of the company or the exercise for which the money was applied?\n\nIn my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough there are regions, in Guysborough County for example, where unemployment is in the range of 20% to 30%. It is devastating for the people in that part of the country. This program, if we are to have faith in it, is aimed specifically at helping depressed regions.\n\nThe tragedy in all of this, and my colleague from the NDP alluded to this, is the absolute cynicism and the absolute loss of any remaining shred of credibility that the government and parliament might have in the country. It is on the chopping block. It is now on the altar.\n\nMr. Speaker, I can assure you that when people look at this their trust and faith is going to go further underground. We heard members of the government, these same individuals and the Prime Minister when in opposition, assuring Canadians that things would be different.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before someone raised the terrible spectre of Brian Mulroney. By comparison, and time will tell, we will see just how legitimate some of these claims are when stacked up against the Mulroney administration.\n\nWe all recall that image we saw of the rat pack, appropriately named. Who can forget the image of the current minister of heritage scrambling over desks, howling like a banshee, to get at a member of the Mulroney government? Where is she now? The silence is deafening when it comes to questions being asked of her own government.\n\nMy colleague from New Brunswick also alluded to the fact that this is hard-working taxpayers' money. This is the blood, sweat and tears of Canadians who give their money to the government in good faith, on the understanding that it will be spent in a responsible fashion, in the belief that the money is going to be used for legitimate purposes.\n\nWhat we need from the government is an accounting. What we need is some semblance of responsible reaction, some transparency. These are the types of words the Prime Minister was very free to throw around while in opposition but very reluctant to embrace now that he is sitting on the government benches. Of course, that is not new. We saw similar platitudes and comments made about things like the GST and free trade. All of these were going to change. They were scrapped along with the helicopter program and most of the red book promises after the election.\n\nWhat we need now is for the government to be completely open about what has taken place. It appears that this so-called scandal goes back to the very beginnings. It goes back to 1993, almost immediately after the government came to power, under the ministry of that now infamous name, Doug Young. The voters of New Brunswick had the good foresight to send Mr. Young a message in the last election. I suggest, and again time will tell, whether under his tutelage in this department the policies, principles and infrastructure were put in place to allow for this scandal to brood, fester and continue for years after.\n\nWe saw an unprecedented attempt by the current minister. It was a simultaneously behind covering and face saving exercise to point behind her to the previous minister, but I think she has to go back a little further to Mr. Young, to the very beginning.\n\nI credit the media for this truth seeking exercise. It really began in the off season. It is astronomical when we think about it, but we know the Prime Minister in his comments to his caucus last week said that they should sit tight, batten down the hatches and this would go away. They have a budget coming and there are other things they can distract the Canadian public with. They can talk about clarity. They can talk about the muddy, ill timed, ill conceived bill they have foisted on the country, and hopefully the real issues of the country will go away, such as the problems in health care, the overburdened taxation system, the problems in education, crippling student debt, underfunding to the military and underfunding for the law enforcement agencies, all of which are not priorities. They will talk about constitutional matters which in the meantime will hopefully distract from the burgeoning and ballooning scandal taking place in the HRD department.\n\nThe timing and sequence of events set out by my colleague from New Brunswick about the infamous fax sheet that was sent with the deleted date were very interesting. Obviously I suggest an attempt was made to distance the minister from knowledge of the first instance when the matter was brought to her attention.\n\nWe know there was a shuffle in cabinet or a change in ministries in August. It stands to reason that an extensive briefing would take place when a new minister took over. The audit was already under way. Surely the previous minister would have had some conversation with the minister to let her know that this was something that might happen on her watch because it had already begun.\n\nThe communication breakdown is not new is this instance. We know of a similar situation. The current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans had dropped in his lap the fact that the Marshall decision was before the supreme court. His predecessor did not take the time to let him know that there was a crisis brewing. A lot of Chinese walls and walls of silence seem to surround the government when it comes to sharing bad news. It certainly does not want to share bad news with the opposition or the Canadian public.\n\nThis is something that goes to the very root of democracy. This goes to the very confidence of Canadians in their government. As painful and as ugly as it may seem, this entire exercise of uncovering what has taken place in this department is necessary if we are somehow to try to restore some semblance of integrity. It is very sad that using the word integrity in the political process has almost become an oxymoron.\n\nI know hon. members opposite do not like to hear this. It is really tough to get hit with the truth, but I want the Canadian public to know that the Progressive Conservative Party supports the motion wholeheartedly. This is perhaps the beginning of the end for the reign of error of the Liberal government.\n\nCanadians are cynical beyond belief and apathy has begun to set in. Parliament has been darkened by the performance of the minister and the government in this regard. The flag over the Peace Tower should be flying at half-staff today. The death of what remaining faith there was in the hearts and minds of Canadians may be on the altar today.\n\nWe need an external audit. It is obvious to everyone in this place and to the millions of Canadians who are watching that this has to take place if there is to be any shred, any scintilla of credibility left in the government. All of what it has said and now all of what it has done are before the Canadian public and have to be laid bare.\n\nI welcome the opportunity to have taken part in this debate and I welcome the opportunity to continue to ask relevant questions of the government. Hopefully we will get some answers.",

There are those of us who have documents and have done research in this area. They are liable to find, just as an example, the Parents for French organization used to get a $130,000 annual contribution from the Mulroney government but just prior to the election it went to $424,000. There was a lot going on in that year about funding special interest groups of all kinds prior to an election.\n\nThe point I want to make to the member is that there is an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. I asked a question of members of the NDP and they dodged the reply. I ask this question of the member opposite. Is he willing to see the same standards of transparency, accountability and performance review that we wish to see in HRDC apply to all other organizations that we see getting funding from government, including those organizations involved in unions, involved in poverty, non-governmental organizations, charities and non-profits? Does he not think one shoe should fit all in terms of accountability and transparency?",

Yet the government seems prepared or more than willing to put money into companies that are already making money. It seems prepared to give money to businesses. Yet it will keep money away from needy Canadians who are a few hours short of qualifying for EI.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to stand in defence of the people of Canada, particularly the people of my wonderful riding of Elk Island, and to address this very timely issue.\n\nYesterday I moved a concurrence motion in the report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. The report which was tabled in the House last November would have addressed this question. Of course the government has been sitting on it. We began the debate and the very first Liberal member who rose moved to stop the debate. Of course the Liberals have the majority and stopped the debate on it.\n\nOne gets the impression that the Liberal pork-barrelling the program we are talking about represents is a favourite program of the government. The Liberals just do not want to see it attacked or criticized or repaired.\n\nI am very pleased to note today that all members on the opposition side have spoken in favour of this very timely motion. It is time that all of us, not only members in the opposition but members on the other side, to do so. They were behind their leader in the last two elections. They said they would follow the leader of the Liberal Party who would take them into power with integrity and who promised a new trust in government. That is wonderful. I believe that people voted for the Liberals because of that promise.\n\nI venture to say in all sincerity that members on the government side will apparently today, so we are told, stand on command and vote against the motion in defiance of their own sense of integrity because they know that this problem has to be fixed.\n\nI will use a bit of my time this morning to give a little math lesson because it has been overlooked so far. The Prime Minister has tried to diminish the size of the problem by saying that only 37 projects are suspect and that the rest are all fine. He is also saying that the 37 being questioned will be clarified and all will be well.\n\nThere are two ways of dealing with a problem like this. One way is by denial, get out the damage control troops to see whether the damage to the Liberal Party and the government of the day can be minimized. The other way is to honestly face up to it.\n\nI have told this story in the House before. I will briefly repeat it and anyone who wants the full story will have to go back. I remember one time in my life when I did something that really was bad. I mentioned this story in the House a couple of years ago. I was a youngster and I suppose I was following the lead of some of the older people in the group. We were out for a bike ride and we ended up at a neighbour's place in the farm country of Saskatchewan. The house was vacant. As I said the last time I related the story, much to my sorrow and personal regret now, when we left not a single window was left in the building because we had broken every one of them by throwing rocks at them. It was dastardly.\n\nI do not know what the other parents did, but my father took me to the owner. I will not mention his name again; the last time Hansard misspelled it because I forgot to give the correct spelling. I had to look that man in the eye and say, “I broke the window”. He also required that I pay it back.\n\nI was a youngster on a Saskatchewan farm in the late forties. We did not have a great deal of money. Money was hard to earn. I picked up beer bottles for about two years and sold them in order to repay the debt. I am grateful to my dad for the lesson he taught me.\n\nTo me, that is a way of solving a problem. When one has erred, the best way of fixing it is to face up to it, admit it and then make restitution.\n\nHere is a situation where the Prime Minister is trying to minimize the problem and explain it away instead of saying to the people of Canada, “Yes, the auditor general in his report brought this problem to our attention and we will do something about it”.\n\nIn fact, nothing was done. The previous member from the Tory party brought out this point too. One of our people made the access to information request. I do not know whether Canadians know this but when a request is made under the Access to Information Act one of the first things that happens is that the department getting the request fires off a warning memo to the minister that says, “Hey, they are looking into something here. Let us be prepared”.\n\nIn a sense that becomes part of the damage control team trying to get the defences ready even before the attack is launched. It just so happened that within a couple of days of that access request being filed the minister said, “Oh, oh, we have been caught. They are on our trail. I guess now we will have to be honest”.\n\nI hesitate to say this, but an honesty that is forcibly extracted somehow rings hollow. I do not want to impute any improper motives to the Prime Minister or to the various ministers who have been involved in this scandal but I think it rings hollow.\n\nGetting to my math lesson, as members know, I have been an instructor of mathematics at the technical institute in Edmonton. I did not specialize in statistics but I know a little about it. One of the things that happens when a sample is done, within a statistical range of error, it is appropriate to apply the results of the sample to the entire population.\n\nFor example, the Liberals like to gloat that right now if 2,000 Canadians were asked how they would vote in the next election, something like 35% or 36% would say they would vote Liberal. How did they get that? Out of the 2,000 people maybe there were 800 or so who said they would vote Liberal. They took the 800 out of 2,000 and extrapolated it to the entire population and said that is how the entire population would vote. That is how statistics work. As a matter of fact statistical methods are used all the time in many different industrial processes and certainly in socioeconomic studies and investigations.\n\nIn this case there were some 30,000 projects. The internal audit came as a result of the auditor general putting his finger on a problem. That is when the internal audit was called and appropriately so. The auditor general pointed out there was a problem way back last April, almost a year ago. The department said that it needed to look into it and fix it, which was an appropriate response.\n\nThe internal audit looked at a random sample of 459 projects. These projects were not chosen because they were suspect; they were picked statistically at random. That is my understanding of how these projects were chosen. Of the 459 we have these percentages. These are the numbers plus or minus a certain range due to statistical variation which is very normal in statistical studies. My guess is that it could be plus or minus 5% or thereabouts.\n\nTaking a sample size of 459 and extrapolating it to 30,000, this is what we have. Of the projects that were reviewed, 15% did not have an application on file. That means out of all of them we could extrapolate to say that there are 4,500 projects that were approved without even having an application on file.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I regret that I have to stand in the House to talk today on a subject of this sort that represents what we would expect to be the very best for Canadians in terms of their use of tax dollars.\n\nI have come to sleuth and to understand more of this big scandal which some would suggest is certainly major mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. I do definitely, individually, have major concerns with the management and the minister's and the whole government's lack of competence in this area.\n\nI would ask this more as a question and the members in the House and people in the gallery and those watching in TV land would be the ones to respond. This government vaunts and boasts often of its competence, managerial ability, fiscal prudence and sound government. We see quite the contrary it would appear. I ask a question and I do not prejudge the outcome but everyone can draw their own conclusions. Is there something of a fraud in the Prime Minister's brag of managerial competence, fiscal prudence and sound government? As I lay out my understanding of what has occurred here I will allow the audience to draw its own conclusions today.\n\nIn a very considerable way what has happened over the last number of weeks, or at least what has been exposed, has drawn into question the jobs fund as a matter of principle and whether it is effective in creating jobs. That is sad in a certain sense. I am a believer that there can be tax dollars targeted for social programs for individuals who are disabled and so on. They need equipment and special access. That maybe is another matter. That is a social program. That is policy set in place to help those who need that leg up in society.\n\nGovernment handouts are very poor at creating jobs in the general sense. If that were not the case then the maritime provinces would obviously be booming, as might other parts of our country.\n\nGenerally speaking, when we are not talking social programs—and there is need for that with respect to disabled and other people—job creation, for the most part, should be done by the private sector. It is the engine that drives job creation. Studies have shown that. It is beyond dispute. Reducing corporate tax, payroll taxes and those kinds of things provide incentive and release money for investment.\n\nIt is a real shame that this $1 billion or more boondoggle seems to be endemic and systemic in the government. It is money that could well be used in other areas. When we have had significant cuts in health and post-secondary education and we have not had the kind of support for farmers in terms of a subsidy war across the world, it is a real shameful thing in my view.\n\nTax dollars are justifiably used for things like health care, post-secondary education and a basic social safety net. After that we do have a consensus to break down from there. What is so preposterous about this is that tax dollars have been used for things that they should not be used for and on the other hand we have had a deficit in respect to health, education and basic social needs.\n\nWe do need social programs that help people with disabilities and so on, but we do not need them as the driving engine to create jobs. This is a fundamental flaw. They do not create jobs as effectively or in any proportion as the private sector would if it was left to do that.\n\nWhen seats throughout the west were held by Reform, we did not say, as some people may have thought, that we did not want our share. We said that we had enough of these kinds of programs. We have had enough of the old way of doing things, the dark ages' way of doing things, by patronage and pork barrelling which comes out of the 1800s and 1900s. In a modern democracy, we should not be doing programs in this manner. The west was not asking “Where is our share?” It was saying “Enough of this kind of stuff, enough of these fiascos”, which are now very apparent.\n\nThe government failed to create jobs in many cases. It gave $14 million to 32 companies but no jobs were created. We can list many of them and we will over the course of the days ahead. Companies in my own province that created zero jobs were Clifford Smith Trucking, $72,000, and Saskatchewan Dutch Elm Disease Committee, $100,000. No jobs were created. I could go on with a list of companies and projects that received money but where not a single job was created.\n\nWe could list companies that have closed. A Cape Breton coffin factory received $400,000 to make fibreglass coffins that would float or last forever underground. Only three of those coffins ever sold and the factory closed.\n\nWe could list companies that have wasted money. In the 1988 audit we found, among other ridiculous kinds of examples, that a road that went nowhere was built through the riding of the then revenue minister Elmer MacKay. Two bridges were built but no roads connected to them. It goes on and on. As a matter of principle, the government has clearly not been creating jobs and in fact cannot do that.\n\nThe government has used this fund and the grants and contributions to give politically motivated handouts. Some have called it a slush fund. I will leave that for others to state. However, the minister certainly did not keep her own rules. There are 15 pages of grants given to the minister's Brant riding, a riding which should not have qualified for grants. Since April 1999, she has approved other projects. Her riding did not have an unemployment rate of over 10%. The earlier qualifying rate had been 12%. She was signing cheques for her own riding contrary to the most basic rule of the Canada jobs fund criteria, which was to create permanent jobs, new jobs, sustainable jobs and so on in areas of high unemployment, areas where there was more than 12% unemployment, later relaxed to 10%. She clearly violated that rule.\n\nHow can Canadians put their trust in a minister who mismanages the money that goes into her own riding?\n\nI can think of other examples that have been mentioned in the House during question period. I refer to the Grand-Mère Inn in the Prime Minister's own riding, the Pierre Corbeil story, an enterprising young Liberal, an individual who thought that he could lever some money for the Liberal coffers by going to them and saying “If you give me a donation, we will make sure your TJF application gets approved”.",

It would not be surprising if many more instances of that turn up.\n\nAs I understand it, a special assistant in the justice minister's riding of Edmonton West by the name of Greg Fergus handled these special representations by ministers, which led to grant approvals in areas that did not strictly qualify. Justice Minister McLellan's riding received $1,350,000 and $888,000 from the transitional jobs fund even though the unemployment rate was lower than the TJF rate.\n\nThere is no accountability to taxpayers and the records are poor. This is not just sloppy, it is systemic. If a dot or a decimal is missing, that is sloppy. If it is patterned like this throughout, that is systemic. The problem the government has is that these are not just a few isolated cases. They run like a thread in terms of patronage and pork barrelling throughout the government. It is endemic.\n\nLet us look at the recent TAGS program: 34% did not contain any proposal to support the project; 83% did not have any supporting documentation; 80% were not checked to see if recipients owed money to HRDC; and 76% did not show any evidence of financial monitoring. That was under the Atlantic groundfish strategy. Other examples could be cited from across various departments.\n\nWe believe some cover-up is going on. We have said before that the minister appeared to have misled the House. On November 17, 1999, she would have had the information in hand and had been fully briefed, yet subsequent to that, on December 1 and again on December 7, she talked about the wonderful and extraordinary job being done to make sure Canadians got back to work. What a wonderful play act. On December 7 she talked about how Canadians approved of this when she was withholding information that would have pointed to the contrary and would have exposed this whole thing.\n\nOne would have to ask, and I believe some have rightly done so, whether the minister is staying in that role because of bloodlines or genetics because her father did not fiscally manage things accurately. Significant dollars were in question when she was in the aboriginal affairs department.\n\nThe Prime Minister's spin on this whole thing is that there are only a few cases. Let us consider that the scathing audit of 459 projects is a representative sample of between 50,000 and 60,000 projects. According to Ms. Brigitte Nolet, a spokesperson for the ministry of human resources, the sample of just under 500 projects represents about 60,000. With that proportion, we still have about 4,800 that have been badly mismanaged.\n\nThis is a major problem. We cannot just minimalize it as the Prime Minister does. It is endemic. It is systemic. It is a pattern of the government and deserves to be dealt with in this manner on this day and rebuked for the good of the Canadian taxpayer.",

But no, we would rather bandy about cheap terms that have little credence. We know that it was not $1 billion missing, but we continue to hear the $1 billion figure. Unfortunately, if we say something long enough we tend to believe it, which is certainly the case across the aisle.\n\nThe fact is, we have 459 projects—",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is hard to stick to the facts when people over there are not listening. I have indicated that there was not $1 billion missing. I have indicated many times, both in the House and outside, that if there is $1 missing we should all be concerned about it. Clearly, on this side of the House, the minister is taking appropriate steps.\n\nThe minister responded very quickly to the call to attend the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development on Thursday. Normally, instead of 10 working days, we have the minister there on Thursday to answer questions, to put the facts on the table.\n\nSome of my colleagues on the other side have already started to dismiss the role of the standing committee because they seem surprised that the minister, who wants transparency, openness and accountability, as everyone on this side of the House and I am sure on that side of the House would like to see, is willing to ensure that the questions which members might have—and I mean questions, not rhetoric—are put on the table. There is no question that we have to have confidence in the system.\n\nBefore the audit was released some colleagues on the other side of the House spoke about projects in their ridings as being worthy, visionary and all so important. Now they cannot wait to say “scandal”. They cannot wait to say “pork-barrelling”.\n\nWhere has this money gone? It has gone to literacy programs. It has gone to job creation programs. It has gone to programs which have benefited communities from one end of the country to the other. Yet we hear these terms being bandied about, without any interest it seems in looking for real solutions to deal with the administrative problems which are clearly unacceptable.\n\nRather than simply shrugging it off, we have designed a six point program. It may not be exhaustive. There may be other constructive suggestions which the committee will be able to present on Thursday to the minister.\n\nThe minister has responded already by indicating that she will provide quarterly updates on the action plan. It is important that every member of parliament be involved to ensure that the dollars my colleague across the way referred to will go to the people and the organizations which have applied, to ensure that there is accountability and to ensure that the proper paperwork has been done. It is unacceptable in this day and age for moneys to be handed out without the proper documentation.\n\nThe audit never suggested political interference. The audit never at any point suggested that there was $1 billion missing. What it indicated was that there was very sloppy bookwork. It is very clear that the six point program that is being implemented as we speak is designed to deal with this.\n\nLet me give the House one example of the program.\n\nTo ensure that the payments are made properly, the director will have to certify the particular project. There will have to be a signed agreement. There will have to be signing authority. Payments will be advanced only when the documentation is there, and I am speaking of documentation in terms of claims, expenses and so on.\n\nSince many members wrote letters of support for projects in their communities, at some point we all believed there was value in the projects they were touting, whether they were literacy programs, job creation programs or whatever.\n\nClearly the point is that we want to make sure there is confidence in the system.\n\nI hear members opposite bandying about terms without any constructive or supportive comments as to how we might fix the problem together. They would rather attack the minister, saying that she should resign. The minister released the report, the action plan, and has made it the number one priority of her department.\n\nNo one is prepared to accept business as usual, certainly not on this side of the House. We want to ensure that we have a system which is strong and comprehensive. We must ensure that the payments are made with every i dotted and every t crossed. They must be carefully checked. All of the files which are active are being reviewed by the department and will be reported on by the end of April.\n\nIt is important that we not lose sight of the fact that these steps are being taken. The auditor general has endorsed the action plan before us. I would like to hear the comments of members opposite in regard to the action plan and the 25 recommendations which were made in the audit.\n\nWe have heard in the media and in the House about the projects that have been approved across the country, how they have benefited the various ridings. Yes, the system has broken down, but we are fixing the system to make sure it never happens in the future.\n\nIt would be folly to continue to use terms and figures which members clearly know are inappropriate. I too am restricted in the terms that I might use in the House.\n\nAt the end of the day, if we are improving the literacy skills of Canadians, if we are giving the people who have disabilities an opportunity to work, if we are giving them meaningful employment opportunities, as has been suggested by many members and organizations, we should not minimize the important role which HRDC plays in communities, and in many cases very visibly, from coast to coast to coast.\n\nIn the short term the minister is taking corrective measures to ensure that payments meet certain financial and program requirements, as well as checking for and correcting problem files. In the longer term we will look at equipping our HRDC staff with the right tools. It is important that they have the tools to do the job. We want accountability, openness and transparency. That is part of the action plan. We want to have measurable and achievable results. And we want to report back not only to the House, but to the public at large.",

On June 12, 1991, he said:\n\nIf there is any bungling in the department, nobody will be singled out. The minister will have to take the responsibility.\n\nYet the Prime Minister made a spectacle of defending the HRD minister. The Prime Minister has no regard for integrity. His minister knew of the bungling of the transitional jobs fund. Yet he defended her when she told the House and Canadians that everything was all right. She now admits that was not true but what she says now is true. Can we believe her? We only know for certain what the auditors have shown us: mismanagement and ineptitude.\n\nThe Liberals do not care about how they spend taxpayer money. They just want more of it. There were 37 tax increases since they took office. As the latest billion dollar boondoggle glaringly shows, when the Liberals get our money they abuse it, misuse it and lose it.",

Canadians know that ministers must be accountable for their own departments.\n\nInstead of following through on its ethical obligations and instead of helping students who are suffering under record high debt the government decides to subsidize billionaire banks. Next, the shipping company owned by the finance minister is interested in buying the assets of Devco, the same crown corporation that through his policies he helped shut down. Is that ethical?\n\nThe questions speak louder than the rhetoric. In this last month alone the examples of just how much the government is out of touch with the needs of ordinary Canadians are shocking.

As we know Beauchesne's citation 495 requires that documents quoted from in the House should be tabled in the House. That is one with which we are familiar.\n\nI also turn to Erskine May at page 63 which talk specifically about ministerial accountability in the House. This is a relatively recent ruling adopted by members of the House in 1996. To read briefly from it, it says:\n\nThat, in the opinion of this House, the following principles should govern the conduct of ministers of the Crown in relation to Parliament: ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and Next Steps Agencies; it is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent errors at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister; ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest—\n\nOver the last couple of days we have seen a spectacle of the House leader and others on the government side providing information on a regular basis to the Prime Minister and other ministers and then refusing to table that same binder, that same information which they have collected from across the country. It is in the public interest. It is not in the public interest to withhold that information. It is in the interest of all Canadians to see that information.\n\nThe reason it is important, not just the few quotes from today but the entire binder of information it has on each and every member of parliament in this place, is that there is a gag order. A gag order has gone out from the government to HRD offices, refusing to even discuss the very documents that members on the opposition and other sides of the House may have communicated with the government. They have been told to refuse to discuss the very documents the government has in the famous binders across the way.\n\nWe have a spectacle where the government is using information garnered from the department, using departmental resources and using ministerial gag orders saying that the information is not to be shared with anyone else. A video has been sent out to all HRD offices explaining how to answer requests for information and how to stymie the process to make sure that information does not get out.\n\nWhat do we have? We have a government using departmental resources to keep information away from members of parliament and from the Canadian public.\n\nThe member's request to table the document, which is a reasonable one, should be extended to the entire packet of information the government has on each and every member of parliament in this place which it is using selectively and to provide information that is not truthful, and which Erskine May says is a contempt of this place.\n\nIt should table not only the documents that were quoted from today and this week in the House of Commons, but I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to ask the government House leader to do the honourable thing and look after ministerial accountability and responsibility. He should do what Erskine May and the House of Commons collectively decided in 1996, and that is not withhold information that is in the public interest. This information is in the public interest and should be tabled in the House of Commons.",

A complete file need not be tabled because one document in it has been cited.\n\nTherefore, if something was quoted from in the House and it is cited, then that document would be tabled.\n\nWhat we have here is a question of do ministers have the right to have materials in the House that they refer to to give answers in the House. I would judge that if all of the briefing notes which were prepared for the ministers had to be tabled, then I think that that would perhaps put the minister at somewhat of a disadvantage and that all of the information that he uses would be cited in public.\n\nI will review the blues, and if the blues do state a specific document was cited and where it was cited, then I will come back to the House if it is necessary. But I will not order that notes that are made either in the House or before they come in the House as briefing notes be released to the House.\n\nOn the other point brought up about accountability of the ministers, I am sure that if the hon. member looks through all of that and if what the hon. member is claiming is that not that there is a matter of opinion on both sides but that there was—now this is my word, the hon. member did not use it—but that in fact there was a deliberate lie, then we are dealing with something else altogether. The minister of course is appointed by the Prime Minister. If the minister feels for whatever reason that he or she should be resigning for whatever reasons he or she has, then that would be his or her decision. Conversely I think that the Prime Minister would have all of the authority that a leader of a party has to dismiss or change the ministers as they are.\n\nOn both counts, one the releasing of the information, I would rule that yes, if it is in a public document cited—and I commit to reviewing the blues to see if indeed there was a document cited in there—and two on the accountability of ministers, I would rule on both cases that the point of order is not granted.\n\nThis point of order is over.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, this debate is on a tripartite motion by the Leader of the Opposition. The first element goes to internal management of the Human Resources Development department. The second relates to ministerial responsibility as a constitutional principle. The third relates to the particular minister actually holding the office of minister. The last two questions are related a little.\n\nIt might be worth noting that the present minister was Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development until as late as August 1999. I had the opportunity of negotiating at great length with her on native land claims in British Columbia as late as August. Most of the matters under discussion occurred or had their origins and were completed well before she entered into office. The issue of ministerial responsibility in the particular case thus has a certain artificial quality to it.\n\nOn the general issue of ministerial responsibility, we might say with some disappointment that the debate in the House has not been very edifying or very useful. It is a principle that developed in the early 17th century constitutional struggles in Great Britain. At that time there was a clear constitutional dichotomy between prerogative power and legislative power, and most of the principles were developed in that context. They apply with difficulty to a situation of fused governmental power. The parliamentary executive was developed in the 19th century and continued to the present.\n\nAgain, what one might call the modern concept of ministerial responsibility relates to the period of constitutional laissez-faire and limited government and probably has little practical relationship to the sort of problems we face today in a period of big government with very large spending power on the part of the government and very large departments of which we have two or three within the present post-war Canadian governmental system. In a certain way it surpasses the capacities of ministers to administer without considerably more sophistication in the administrative processes and structures available to them. It is perhaps a little disappointing therefore that so little has been said in follow up to the principle of ministerial responsibility and what it means in terms of concrete changes and modernization of governmental structures and processes.\n\nI noted with interest the present minister's immediate responses to the situations that have been discussed in the House in the last two days: the internal changes which are being made without constitutional amendment and intensified staff training on administration. They involved the introduction of the principle of accountability of managers for the results of their programs; disciplinary action if gross mismanagement or fraudulent activities are revealed; the creation of a new audit group; the review of all active files by April 30, 2000; and ensuring files are complete before the contract is signed and that all requests for payment are accompanied by a check list containing necessary financial information. These are good steps and we welcome their introduction.\n\nI think we should ask members of the House, both government and opposition but I think with particular reference to opposition members, what exactly they did or saw as their function as members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. These are all-party committees. The agenda is subject to consensus formation. The opportunity to ask for files and to review them is there.\n\nI find it interesting that there seems to have been an absence of information on the part of members when specific issues have been raised of grants made to their constituencies. They do not seem to have been aware of that fact, and one wonders why.\n\nThe responsibility of a member of parliament or a member of a committee is to keep oneself appraised of the details of administration. It is always within the power of a committee to demand production of files or to demand the appearance of officials. With certain of the committees of parliament this is a fact of life. Some of them have been quite robust committees and quite rambunctious in the process.\n\nI note with particular interest the surprise of the member for Vancouver East, a very much respected individual, that a total of $37 million in grants went to Vancouver East. As a resident of Vancouver I cannot think of a better area of the city to receive $37 million. I might even wonder whether that is enough. But, again, are members of parliament not utilizing to the full their role as members of committees or their role of individual members? In other words it is a case, as Bentham said, of judge and company, in this case government and members of parliament. There is more than one party involved in this whole process.\n\nEvery file that comes to my office, infrastructure, millennium grants and the like, is scrutinized closely. I have a subcommittee within my parliamentary offices and we go through them in great detail. We rank the applications hierarchically and I think it has been one of the factors in enabling us to present cases to ministers and to others for grants. I think that is part of the responsibility of a member.\n\nYears ago I gave evidence to the McRuer commission set up by the Government of Ontario. James McRuer was a great chief justice of Ontario and was concerned with complaints of administration of grants and other programs within the Government of Ontario.\n\nChief Justice McRuer asked me to appear as a witness and to present evidence on this issue. Is there a crisis in government? Does it affect individual rights? Could we have advice on structures and processes of government? I repeat these simply because I think they are germane to the problem of the growth of big government in Canada, the phenomenon of certainly the last 25 years, the big spending governments, when we have accepted social responsibility for the welfare of citizens in health care, education and related matters.\n\nAt the time the McRuer commission was set up there were a series of debates in universities and elsewhere. Professor Hayek of Road to Serfdom was predicting the end of democratic government because administration was becoming so complex. Professor George Keeton, who was a top English jurist at the time, wrote a book, the Passing of Parliament . Parliament was disappearing simply because of the strains on executive government.\n\nThe obvious conclusion was that the post-modern British derived system of the parliamentary executive was not responding as well to these problems as other systems that have the separation of powers like the United States and other countries have, and to a certain extent like Great Britain had in the early 17th century when the great constitutional struggles on ministerial responsibility emerged.\n\nThe United States set up a commission under ex-president Herbert Hoover, the Hoover Commission on Government. It recommended substantial reforms within the United States system, which I brought to the notice of the McRuer commission.\n\nIn a certain sense the pro-active concern of the Canadian parliament under all governments in the last 40 years with the Quebec issue at the expense of other and larger constitutional administrative law reform issues has hurt us in taking effective action in advance of problem situations, situations such as we face today.\n\nOne of the recommendations made to the McRuer commission was the establishment of a uniform administrative procedure code applying to all government departments. A second was for a specialized Conseil d'Etat administrative tribunal having jurisdiction over all governmental operations. A third was personal liability of civil servants and others for misconduct, including gross negligence in the administration of their operations, personal liability, civil law damages and the like if that is necessary.\n\nThe present minister proposes recovery of misspent funds. It is a step in that direction. I recommend to the House, if we can carry this debate constructively further and if all parties would agree, that a priority should be a general overall structural review of administrative processes in government.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my hon. colleague from Surrey Central. It is a pleasure to speak to the situation if for no other reason than it brings to light an endemic and systemic problem within the government that has been occurring on the government's watch since it was elected.\n\nThis is nothing that began overnight. It did not begin with the audit for which the member for Calgary—Nose Hill had been pushing for a long time. It did not bespeak the 459 programs that have been brought to the floor of the House, showing a miserable lack of accounting. It bespeaks a problem that is running through many departments. I will begin with the HRD and will go to a few others after.\n\nWhat actually took place here? Some 459 plus projects were looked at randomly in the audit that was done as a direct result of Reform Party insistence and pushing for a very long period of time. Of those programs, 15% did not have an application on file. Of the remaining applications, the following elements were missing: 72% had no cash flow forecasts; 46% had no estimate of the number of people participating; 25% had no description of the activities that were being supported; 25% had no apt description of the participants; 11% had no budget; 11% had no description of expected results; and 97% of the files showed no evidence that anyone had been checked to see whether they owed money to HRD, a requirement to determine whether or not the program fits the bill. Eight out of ten files reviewed did not show any evidence of any financial monitoring on the part of HRD, and 87% of the project files showed no evidence of supervision. I could go on.\n\nThe response from the Prime Minister is that in this small cross-section are all the problems we have. That is absolute nonsense. To think that this random cross-section, which shows such endemic mismanagement, represents the only problems faced by HRDC is, at best, short-sighted and, at worst, refers to things that we cannot mention in this place because they would be in the realm of unparliamentary language.\n\nWhat does it actually bespeak? It bespeaks mismanagement and a lack of respect. It is a lack of respect for the taxpayers of Canada who break their backs to pay money to this institution, which should spend it in a responsible manner. It is a lack of respect for all Canadians and it is a lack of respect for the money the government receives. It is looked at as the government's money, and the government demonstrates that time and time again.\n\nThis is not the government's money. It belongs to some poor sod who is paying taxes on the $19,000 a year which he earns. It is his money. It is the money of 30 million Canadians. It is not the Liberals' money. It is not the Reform Party's money. It is the people's money. It is up to the government to manage it properly.\n\nThe government has prized itself, falsely as we can now prove, on being a good manager of the public purse. We have shown that not only is it an appalling manager, but when faced with irrefutable facts of its mismanagement, it obfuscates, it puts the issue under the carpet and pretends there is no problem. That is not only an insult to this institution; worse, it is an insult to all the taxpayers who pay money to the government.\n\nThe member for Mississauga West stood this morning to go on a pathetic tirade over issues that are completely irrelevant to what is taking place. The member stood and said that the Reform Party is against job creation, that it is against developing programs for places with high unemployment rates, particularly in certain sectors of Canada and in aboriginal communities. That money is meant for this purpose. We do not dispute that at all. We want to make sure that these places have higher rates of employment. However, every member of the opposition wants the money to be spent in a responsible way. We do not want the money to be used as a tool for pork-barrelling. We do not want it to be used cynically as a means to gain power. But that is exactly what has been taking place for far too long.\n\nThis did not happen overnight. For over 10 years the auditor general has been saying that HRDC has had a great deal of difficulty keeping its finances on track. In previous reports it has been stated that HRDC has been unable to monitor what was going on to ensure the money was being spent wisely.\n\nThe question which I pose to the government is: Why did it take until the year 2000 for the government to admit, in a backhanded way, that it has a problem? It does not have a little problem; it has a massive problem. It is a chronic problem that is faced not only by the programs within HRDC but by a lot of other programs.\n\nI have worked on reserves and I have seen some of the most impoverished people of the land. The money which is targeted to help those people, to deal with the rampant unemployment amongst them, to give them the skills which they need, does not get to them. We can go to many reserves and see people living at levels of poverty which are akin to what we would see in third world countries. Children lie on concrete slabs in the middle of winter. Multiple families live in houses that are boarded up, without central heating and with soiled mattresses on the living room floor. There are drunk people all over the place and children who have infections all over their bodies. We probably would not see this situation outside these communities.\n\nMoney is earmarked to help these people, but for years they have not received that money. That is in part why there is deplorable, abject poverty in those communities. It is not because the money is not there. There were billions of dollars involved in the minister's previous portfolio. She knew full well what was going on. The member for Skeena brought it up time and time again, as did the member for Wild Rose, the leader of this party and other members of the opposition. Money is being spent by the department of Indian affairs, but that money is not getting to the people. The auditor general has brought that up time and time again, but the government puts its blinkers on and says it does not have a problem.\n\nThis is the tip of an iceberg that is very large. The honourable thing to do, beyond the minister resigning, would be for the government to finally come clean with the Canadian public and say that it will do an audit or it will listen to the auditor general and others and fix the problem. If the government does not fix the problem and make sure that taxpayer money is used as it was designed to be used, to help those who cannot help themselves, then it should leave because it is not doing its job. If the government professes to be the manager of the public purse, then it should do the honourable thing. Those responsible should either resign or fix the problem, together with opposition members. All members have people in their ridings who are suffering and the problem needs to be fixed now.\n\nThere are other things, such as western economic diversification and ACOA. The people at CIDA just found $850 million. The member for Surrey Central will speak later about the $850 million of CIDA money that was given with no or minimal accountability to Canadian companies. That money was designed to help the poorest of the poor. It has gone into the pockets of companies making millions of dollars. Why should the Canadian International Development Agency be giving money, with no accountability, to private companies to spend onshore? That is not what taxpayer money is for.\n\nThe government should do the honourable thing. The minister should quit, the government should fix the problems right away and come clean in all of the other ministries to ensure that taxpayer money is spent wisely.",

On the surface of things the transitional jobs fund was supposed to serve exactly that purpose. It was supposed to help people in regions of high unemployment, higher than 12%. We in the NDP support that initiative and we always have supported that kind of initiative.\n\nPeople in my constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar did not qualify for this job creation program because, thankfully, our unemployment rate is far below 12%. There are very few areas in Saskatchewan which qualified for this program because our rate of unemployment is considerably lower than the threshold.\n\nI believe that people in my constituency and throughout Saskatchewan would support a program that would move resources to regions of the country where there is high unemployment. Where there is high unemployment there is always resulting poverty. That was what the program was intended to do, if it had been administered cleanly, but this program was not administered cleanly. This program became a vehicle for Liberal pork-barrelling and political interference.\n\nAs we know, the Prime Minister's riding alone received grants of over $7 million, 17 of them. We know that the human resources development minister's riding also benefited liberally, even though her riding, like mine, did not officially qualify. There is real evidence that there was political interference to the benefit of Liberal ministers. My friend mentioned the word “cynical”. I find this a cynical and disgusting attack on the unemployed and the poor. This Liberal slush fund is a shame and a scandal.\n\nAs my friend mentioned, government ministers must take responsibility for their actions, and I agree with him that the Minister of Human Resources Development must resign.\n\nCan my hon. friend comment on the effects of this kind of pork-barrelling and the other examples he mentioned, like CIDA? That is an example which is of much interest to me. Can he comment on what effects this kind of pork-barrelling and cynicism have in the long run on the electorate and on the body politic?",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, after the thorough, thoughtful and to the point speech by my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak on the Reform Party's supply day motion expressing our deep concern and the outrage of many Canadians over the gross mismanagement of grants and contributions by the Department of Human Resources Development totalling more than $1 billion annually, which is not a typo but $1 billion annually, and our lack of confidence in the minister.\n\nWe on this side of the House will take this opportunity to let Canadians know that we endorse the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, something that is sorely lacking under the current Liberal administration.\n\nToday is the second day of the sitting of the House in the new year. On New Year's Eve, which I spent with my constituents in Cloverdale, everyone was excited as we moved from the past millennium to this millennium. I looked through the eyes of my constituents, and all Canadians, to their dreams. Canadians were dreaming of the government of the day building a strong and wide bridge over which all Canadians would cross from the previous millennium to this millennium.\n\nIn the new millennium their dreams are that their taxes will be reduced, that jobs will be created, that there will be no brain drain. We are hoping that the government will return the billions it has cut from health care and education.\n\nThey are dreaming of pension reform, policies that strengthen families and family values that are respected. Their are dreaming of a criminal justice system that will serve the needs of the victims not the criminals. They are dreaming of a federation that will be based on equality and democratic principles that will be followed in federal institutions. They want accountability in government and they we want the government to listen to the people. These are their dreams.\n\nThis weak Liberal government has no political will and no vision. Rather than fulfilling those dreams, we have unfortunately come back to the House in the new millennium confronted with the biggest boondoggle yet. This billion dollar boondoggle shows us that maybe every federal department is being mismanaged. It seems to be a systemic problem.\n\nWith only 1% of the grant moneys spent by HRDC being examined, we have discovered a great deal of mismanagement.\n\nI will not repeat the facts, percentages and figures reported in the audit because my colleagues have already highlighted them. I will give some examples to the House to show the kinds of cases we are talking about. In one case, a sponsor submitted a $60,000 proposal but received $150,000. After verification, the sponsor indicated that only $30,061 should have been claimed.\n\nIn another case, out of the $50,547 in verified claims for one file, more than half of that money was the salary of two persons during the first three weeks of the project.\n\nAnother example shows that a firm was paid $150,000 out of which $30,000 was used for overhead expenses with no accompanying explanation. There was no business plan, just two pages of description; no feasibility study and no rationale on the file for recommending it. The project's length was extended and the grant increased to $420,000 with no clear explanation.\n\nThere are numerous examples. In the Prime Minister's own riding, where most of the money went, the job creation rate was negative. Bankruptcies were filed after receiving the grant money.\n\nHundreds of businesses disproportionately located in the hometowns of Liberal cabinet ministers received government grants without anyone checking where the money went. In some cases, out of those 459 examined, the grateful recipients did not even fill out any application forms.\n\nThe problem does not stop there. The worst is yet to come. This is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe transitional jobs fund name was changed to Canadian jobs fund. I suggest to my Liberal friends that they should change the name again to the Liberal slush fund and amalgamate all the slush funds from other organizations so that they can pork-barrel and use this slush fund for buying votes as they do.\n\nIn April 1998, I questioned the minister responsible for CIDA on the lack of accountability in spending of CIDA's industrial co-operation program called CIDA Inc. Out of that $815 million, half of that money was spent in Quebec. This taxpayer money was given out without follow-up processes to monitor how the money was spent. The question is not where the money was spent but how the money was given out. Canadians do not get money for feasibility studies from the banks.\n\nThe audit commissioned by CIDA Inc. concluded that the benefits were overestimated and that information on projects and companies were incomplete and inaccurate. The minister could not account for CIDA Inc. funds to the tune of almost one billion dollars. The audit also identified other serious problems, including the fact that 33% of the money was allocated to just 7% of companies that applied.\n\nThe auditor general's office prodded CIDA to conduct a follow-up audit last year and the depressing results were quietly released just before Christmas.\n\nThe 1999 version of the audit showed that the problems at CIDA Inc. were not only continuing but in many cases had become worse. In more than 33% of the cases, money was paid out even though mandatory reports were not filed at all. No reports were filed on 10% of the projects and 33% of the money went to only 4.4% of the companies that applied. This was worse than the 1997 audit results.\n\nThe lack of proper accounting at both CIDA Inc. and HRDC, and many other government departments, like Western Economic Diversification or ACOA, is part of a much larger problem of billions of dollars being spent each year on grants and contributions.\n\nThere are charges of political interference from the top down, interference from government cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister. Incidentally, the former minister of CIDA was also the former minister of HRDC.\n\nNo one has assumed responsibility for these boondoggles even though they are backed up by the audit and the cases number in the dozens. The amounts involved are huge.\n\nThe head of the civil service has refused to take responsibility for his bureaucrats. In turn, the human resources minister has refused to take responsibility for him. The Prime Minister, in turn, has refused to take responsibility for her. The former minister of HRDC has blatantly refused to assume the responsibility. Why can they not take responsibility rather than cover up and engage in damage control?\n\nNow we hear that the government has issued gag orders to government officials so that they cannot share the information with opposition members.\n\nI have a private member's bill in the House, which I will be introducing soon, concerning whistle blower legislation. If that was in place these problems would probably have been prevented because the government's weaknesses, the corruption and mismanagement of those funds, would have surfaced.\n\nThere are many questions that remain unanswered. Canadians want to know if the Liberals will admit that these grants are political slush funds to buy voters with their own money. They also want to know if the previous HRD minister will admit that he knew about the missing money and, if he did, why he did nothing about it when he was in office.\n\nThere are many other questions. Will the Prime Minister take any action? He has always campaigned that he would show responsibility in government.",

The Fanshawe College, with the help of Human Resources Development Canada, got a grant of $19,800 to promote summer student jobs.\n\nI am in a rural area with a lot of small communities. It was Fanshawe's responsibility over the last couple of years to go to the small communities to promote summer student employment. It did a very good job.\n\nWhen it came to reporting time, Fanshawe College came to HRDC and said that it was an educational institution and that it want to know what it should do about the GST in terms of its input cost. It wanted to know if it could claim back 100% like it had in other areas.\n\nBecause Fanshawe College was one of the 475 projects that was picked out, the auditors came from Montreal. They went through the college's books and said that everything was fine, but that it could only claim 50% of the GST not 100%. So Fanshawe College had to give back $200 in GST. That is one of the 37 examples that those people across the floor keeps saying is mismanaged money.\n\nSummer jobs for students is vitally important in my riding. The jobs that Fanshawe College has provided, and the jobs that the department and the minister have provided in terms of more money going toward summer student employment, has helped my riding and the young people living there.\n\nHearing that fact, does the hon. member not agree that without knowing all the facts on these cases the motion put forward by his party is a little off base?",

It also gives me a chance to explain to the members in the House and to Canadians the things that we are doing at Human Resources Development Canada to set things right.\n\nI am the first to acknowledge that the internal audit that we received identified deficiencies in the administration of our grants and contributions programs. The grants and contributions we are talking about are moneys that go to Canadians with disabilities to help them to obtain the skills they need to get and hold a job.\n\nIt is money that goes to young Canadians for summer jobs, for internships so they can get that very important experience that they need to continue over the course of their lives to participate in our economy.\n\nIt is money that goes to Canadians who want to learn to read, to our literacy grants and contributions; Canadians who are not at the rate and the level of literacy so they can participate fully in society and the economy and get an opportunity to learn.\n\nIt is money that goes to Canadians who have not been able to find work through targeted wage subsidies, through self-employment assistance and to their communities where there may not be a diversified economy to help build new opportunities and jobs for men and women who want and need them.\n\nThose are the kinds of programs we are talking about. I can tell the House that when I got the results, I was concerned.\n\nFrom my point of view the right thing to do was to make it public, to tell Canadians that we have a challenge in the department but we are prepared to fix it. From my point of view, Canadians can have greater faith in a department that is prepared to identify its problems and commit itself to improve them, to fix them, than in a department that sweeps them under the carpet and does not pay attention. For me, that is what government should be about, to be able to continuously improve.\n\nCanadians appreciate and understand that times change, people change, circumstances and technology change. We have to keep up. But we have to be able to recognize where the challenges exist and then have the capability and the force to make those improvements. That is what this is about.\n\nWe actually looked at the audit and what it said and did not say and there are some points I want to make. First and foremost the audit did not say that $1 billion disappeared. We know where the cheques have been sent. They have been sent to educational institutions, to community organizations, not for profit organizations, to small and medium size businesses and to individuals in the ridings of every single member of parliament in this House.\n\nThe audit did not measure the results of these programs. We do that every year in our performance analyses which are part of the estimates that are presented to this House and debated in committee.\n\nThe audit did not talk about political interference. How could it? As I said, these programs, these grants and contributions, are found in the ridings of members from the New Democratic Party, the Reform Party, the Bloc, the Conservatives and indeed here among Liberal members of parliament. But they are there to help communities and individuals in need.\n\nI put my focus on what the audit did say. The audit looked at how we administer these very important projects. It looked at whether there were applications on file. It looked at whether the rationale for a project was included in the file. It looked to see if we were monitoring the receipts that we got from groups and organizations and individuals that identified and itemized the ways in which they spent the money that had been forwarded to them. These are important things because they are the foundation of the programs that we are managing.\n\nThe audit said that we can do a significantly better job. As the audit indicated, because in some cases there was not an application, it did not mean that there had not been one or there was not one somewhere else. It just meant it was not in the file. If there was not a rationale it did not mean that the project was not a good project. It just meant it was not written in the file. But for me, the files do have to be complete. We have to be able to confirm to Canadians why the investments we are making with their tax dollars are the right investments.\n\nI have taken this audit very seriously. As I say, from my point of view the administrative management is the foundation of our work. It supports these grants and contributions, these projects that we know are important in the lives of Canadians and their communities. My job as minister is to shore up this foundation, to make sure it is strong, because when a foundation shifts or is weakened, that which it holds up can also become weakened. For me, the responsibility that I have as minister is to take this seriously, to do what I have to do to shore up the foundation, to make it strong. I am prepared to do that.\n\nWhat is interesting about this is that that is the story, the story of a department that through its own series of checks and balances identified an opportunity for improvement, that made this information available to Canadians in a transparent fashion and asked Canadians to recognize what we are doing and then to measure it by the work that we do to improve it.\n\nThe opposition says that we are hiding something. How can that be when we have made the report public, when it is available for Canadians to deal with? I guess they do not have the same values of transparency and openness that we on this side of the House feel to be very important.\n\nAnother thing that is interesting is that we hear from individual members of parliament that they do not think we should be investing in hotels or in golf courses or in Bible colleges. What those members do not understand is that they are talking about people. They are talking about the people who have had the opportunity to get employment at these hotels, at the golf courses, or to get a summer job at a Bible college. Those people who listen to the members of parliament challenging those undertakings must be asking is this job not good enough? We know it is good enough for them. They know and they appreciate and they want the government to participate in providing opportunities for them so that they can benefit from the greatness that we know is ours as Canadians.\n\nWhen we look at this from our side of the House we know that the government can play a significant role in the lives of individuals and that we can partner effectively with communities to create opportunities to strengthen both the social and economic realities that are theirs. That is what we believe in on this side and no one will change that. That is why for me it is so important to take this audit and to deal with it wisely, effectively and fully.\n\nI would just like to share with the House some of the letters that we have received that tell us we are right to support these grants and contributions. We hear from Eric Boyd, the managing director of the Canadian Paraplegic Association. Mr. Boyd writes:\n\nWith the $1.7M provided by the Opportunities Fund over 3 years, I am pleased to report that we have been able to lever an additional $1.5M from our Corporate Campaign to support our employment programs. I'm even more pleased to report that the Association has been able to increase its annual job placements from 500 to 750 in just one year, resulting in annual savings to taxpayers in excess of $18M.\n\nHere is another from Carolyn Emerson who is working at Memorial University of Newfoundland in the women in science and engineering program. She writes:\n\nFunding for the WISE Students' salaries during the ten years of the program has come primarily from HRDC's Summer Career Placement Program from almost all of the Canada Employment Centres around the province. That support is most gratefully acknowledged and has been a real investment in young Canadians, an investment that is reaping dividends as they enter the workforce.\n\nThis one is from Barbara Mulrooney and Barbara Linehan. They are the co-owners of B & B Crafts. They are in Placentia, Newfoundland. They say:\n\nThrough this fund we are proud to say how we feel about the difference our business has made in our lives. This fund has enabled us to get up every morning and proudly say that we have to go to work. It has raised our self-esteem and confidence through the pride we feel and see in our work.\n\nAgain, I just point out that from our point of view these grants and contributions are extraordinarily important. They make a difference in the lives of Canadians and in their communities. From my point of view as Minister of Human Resources Development, when I see that there is a job to be done to improve our administration, I take that seriously, and I will ensure that we work to fix it.\n\nIn that regard we have worked very, very closely with experts to build a plan that will ensure that this problem is fixed; to ensure that this problem never happens again; to ensure that our foundation is strong and these grants and contributions are supported. I would like to give the House the highlights.\n\nFirst of all, we will ensure payments meet our financial requirements. That means that no payments will go out until the local director at a human resources development centre, or the director general, certifies that the project file meets the new financial criteria. There are no new agreements that will be approved until we have signed confirmation that the project file contains all the essential elements. All active files will be reviewed by April 30 to certify that they are complete.\n\nSecond, we will check and correct all problem files. We have been talking about this. We are investigating 37, now 34 because we have completed some, audit cases where financial rules may have been broken. I underline may, because in the three we have already closed we found no difficulty. The paperwork was found and things were as they should have been. We also note that any similar cases that are identified through a review of active files will be investigated and resolved in the same way, and any cases of suspected fraud or other illegal activity will be referred to the police.\n\nThird, and this is very important, we will provide improved training and support for staff. This means that we will provide them with the direction, tools, training and additional resources that are needed. We will review and improve accountability and management structures and work processes to make sure we have our structures right. We will complete the first round of training and make sure that by February our financial criteria are understood by all and that their responsibilities are understood.\n\nThere is a point I want to make here. What I do not want to do is build a system that sucks the accountability and responsibility all back to headquarters. We have worked very hard to build a service delivery model. We are at the local level. We can deal with individual citizens and with their community members to get the important grants and contributions into their hands in a timely fashion. That has worked well and that has been a great success in our department.\n\nNow what I want to do is work to provide them with a system that will also allow them to be fully accountable and transparent to the Canadian taxpayer and ensure that the investments we are making, the tax dollars we are investing, are followed dollar by dollar. This is important to me and it is modern comptrollership that we are talking about here and that we can achieve.\n\nThe fourth aspect of our six point plan says that we will ensure accountability to judge results. We will ensure that the implementation of the action plan is part of the basic job requirement for all managers involved in grants and contributions. I am going to receive quarterly reports on our progress starting in April 2000. Those reports will be made public because I do want Canadians to judge us against our actions. We will have external reviews of our progress in June 2000 and January 2001.\n\nFifth, we will get the best advice available. We have presented the new system to the Treasury Board comptrollership standards advisory board and we have incorporated its advice. We have incorporated the suggestions from our meeting with the auditor general. We have also contracted with Deloitte & Touche who have advised us on the integrity of our plan and have given us suggestions on modern comptrollership.\n\nFinally, and this is extremely important, we will report on our progress publicly. As I have mentioned, to me that is a priority. We will report to the media on our follow-up of the 37 cases. We will brief the media on our quarterly reports. We will provide information to the Canadian public and I will appear before the parliamentary committee of human resources on this topic this week.\n\nI would like to share for the record the reaction of the auditor general to this plan. He said in his letter to our deputy dated February 7, “In our opinion, the proposed approach represents a thorough plan for corrective action to address the immediate control problems that were identified”.\n\nI am taking the job as Minister of Human Resources Development seriously. I can also say that my department is taking this seriously. I have spoken with employees from coast to coast to coast. They want a better system. They want better tools. They want to continue to serve Canadians in the best possible fashion.\n\nThe department is committed to this plan. It is committed to this work and supports it fully. Together we are going to ensure that we have the best administrative practices when it comes to grants and contributions. We will continue to support these projects which are so vitally important in the ridings of each and every member of the House of Commons.\n\nFor me this is about ministerial responsibility. It is about taking information that says we can do a better job, making it public, building a plan of action that is approved by experts from the outside, and then committing to the people of the country to implement it, to fix the problem, to make it work and together to continue to build a strong Canada.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in the House on the motion presented by the official opposition which holds in question the department of human resources and the minister.\n\nThe Liberals prior to the elections of 1993 and 1997 supposedly took the high road when they approached Canadian voters. I quote the Prime Minister as reported in Hansard in 1991:\n\nI would like to tell the people of Canada that when we form the government, every minister in the cabinet that I will be presiding over will have to take full responsibility for what is going on his department. If there is any bungling in the department, nobody will be singled out. The minister will have to take the responsibility.\n\nI also quote the Prime Minister as reported in Hansard in 1994:\n\nThere can be no substitute for responsibility at the top. I vow to you, to this House, to Canadians, that I will never abdicate that responsibility. I will never pass the buck.\n\nI guess that leads us into the motion today and what has happened. Canadians have an expectation. Canadians are those hard working taxpayers who work long hours. They are the men, women and young adults who are starting their careers as workers. They give part of their money to the Government of Canada to spend on their behalf to provide programs for other Canadians and for themselves. They expect the government to manage the spending of their money with due diligence and to make sure that it is not wasted. Lord knows that Canadians pay enough taxes. They certainly are not looking to the government to waste it on their behalf.\n\nThe question is: What did Canadians actually get? The auditor's report is quite clear as to what they got. They got a government which takes very lightly the responsibility of managing taxpayers' money. They got a government which does not seem to understand that the money comes from the taxpayer and not some location like a tree. Canadians got a government which refuses to assume responsibility for the management of that money.\n\nThe auditor's report revealed that money had been given out but there were files which did not even have applications for the money. It revealed that there was a lack of supervision, a lack of concern as to where the money was supposed to go. There was no plan as to where the money was supposed to go. There was a real lack of management and administration. There was a lack of supervision, a lack of documentation, but, more importantly, a lack of understanding by the minister in charge of the department. She is responsible to make sure that the department manages the spending of taxpayers' money properly.\n\nWhat Canadians are getting is a message from the Prime Minister and from his government that we do not have to take responsibility for our actions. That is the message the Prime Minister is sending, not only to us, but to other ministers; that they will not be held accountable for things in their departments that would represent poor decision making, bad management or lack of accountability. The Prime Minister is sending the message to his ministers that they will not ever be held accountable for the misuse or mismanagement of taxpayer money.\n\nThe message he is sending to Canadians in general is that they do not have to take responsibility for the way they report to government through government programs. They do not have to take responsibility for fudging figures or accounts, or losing documentation which may be required by Revenue Canada. How can it be all right for the department to access money or submit a report without all of the documentation but not be all right for the ordinary Canadian? Canadians are getting the message from the Prime Minister and his government that they do not have to take responsibility.\n\nWhen I speak about Canadians I want to single out young Canadians who are just entering adulthood and the workforce. What kind of message are they receiving by the government's actions? What message are they entering adulthood with? That it is okay to walk away from problems? That it is okay to cover up reality, the truth? That it is okay to give out questionable information? What message are we giving to the young people who will one day sit in the House of Commons in leadership positions?",

That is what bothers me.\n\nWe have leadership in our country which is sending the wrong message, which is showing a bad example to Canadians. I think that Canadians deserve better. I think that Canadians deserve a government which will use due diligence in managing taxpayers' money, which will respect the fact that its money comes from ordinary Canadians who are working day in and day out to raise families and to provide not only for their families but for themselves and their communities. I think that Canadians deserve to have a government which recognizes that there are people who cannot look after themselves, who need assistance, but that assistance is given on merit and not for political reasons. Canadians deserve to have a government which recognizes that politics should be separate from government; that government, when it is spending taxpayers' money, should not be making decisions based on raising election funds or gathering votes. It should be a government which spends taxpayers' money to provide programs for Canadians, programs and funds based on merit and merit only.\n\nThere may be a reason for some of these programs, but there is never a reason for bad management. There is never a reason for making decisions based on politics rather than merit. There is never a reason for having one set of rules for the minister and a different set of rules for everybody else. There is never a reason for covering up what actually happened. That is not what Canadians deserve.\n\nCanadians deserve a government that will give the truth as it is, not as the government sees it. Canadians deserve a government that will do the right thing for the right reasons. They do not deserve a government that will hide behind the back of the Prime Minister or the skirts of the minister of HRDC. They deserve a government which will face the responsibility that was given to it by the voters of Canada to govern with integrity. Canadians deserve nothing less.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to address the opposition day motion. We are taking head-on the issue of whether the government should be engaging in the types of actions that it has engaged in over the last months and years. It has taken taxpayers' money and spent it on all kinds of questionable activities without doing the proper accounting. In fact, we would argue that in many cases there seem to be absolutely no rules at all when it comes to how the government spends money through the Department of Human Resources Development.\n\nI want to start by running through some of the facts and reiterating some of the things my colleague said a minute ago. They bear repeating because they are important. I do not think anyone could argue that this is one of worst cases of neglect and abuse of taxpayers' money in the history of Canada. I do not think people could argue that. We are talking about a billion dollars.\n\nMy colleague mentioned a minute ago that two days after the Reform Party filed an access to information request for a copy of an internal audit done in the Department of Human Resources Development the minister called together a very hasty press conference and revealed that there were all kinds of problems in her department and the fact that she had known about this for months and months on end but had done absolutely nothing about it.\n\nHere is what that audit revealed. Of the 459 project files reviewed, 15% did not have an application on file from the sponsor. Of the remaining applications the following elements were missing: 72% had no cash flow forecast; 46% had no estimate of the number of participants; 25% had no description of the activities to be supported, yet cheques were cut and money went out; 25% provided no description of the characteristics of participants; 11% had no budget proposal; and 11% had no description of expected results. Ninety-seven per cent of all files reviewed showed no evidence that anyone had checked to see if the recipient already owed money to HRDC or to the government. Eight out of ten files reviewed did not show evidence of financial monitoring, and 87% of project files showed no evidence of supervision. That is what was happening in this department for months and months on end.\n\nWe now know that this went back before the current human resources minister and that the previous minister, now the Minister for International Trade, was also aware of this. My colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill questioned both ministers at various times and they assured the House there were no problems in that department, that everything was above board and that all the applications were being scrutinized.\n\nWe can see that simply was not true. The audit proves that. But what does the government do? It does not say it is sorry. The minister does not resign, which is the honourable thing to do when one blows a billion dollars. The minister somehow finds the courage to stand and say it is no big deal. I do not know how she can do that. I do not know how she can say that they have implemented a six point plan and it is no problem now. We are talking about a billion dollars.\n\nI do not know if my colleagues across the way have been out in their ridings over the last month and a half, but if they have, they will have found that people are concerned about the state of health care in Canada today. They are asking how is it that the government can blow all this money on these grants and not really know where it ended up, yet health care goes lacking.\n\nIn my riding we were promised emergency aid for the farmers. I should point out in fairness to the people in my riding that they are not simply asking for subsidies, but they do say they were promised this. They are wondering what happened, because they told the bankers that they would be getting this. It has not shown up but a billion dollars has just blown out the door through human resources development. It is absolutely scandalous.\n\nWhen we analyse this what do we find? First of all I have run through some of the facts. Obviously there are simply no rules when it comes to spending money in human resources development. We are talking about a program where they really do have freestyle grant giving. There are no rules. It is chequebook politics. The department cuts all kinds of cheques. There are no application forms.\n\nCertainly there were a lot of questions about the propriety of what happened in the Prime Minister's riding. The few rules that there are were seemingly broken in order to ensure that money got into the hands of people who were big political supporters of the Prime Minister. It is absolutely scandalous.\n\nWe found out that once the cheques were sent out there was no real accounting. The best examples are some of the things that were in the paper today.\n\nMcGill University was seeking $60,000 and someone made a little error and gave it $160,000. That can happen, but if there is some kind of financial system in place we get the $100,000 back. But those guys over there did not catch it and $100,000 is just gone. McGill says “We decided that we really needed it so we will just hold on to the $100,000”.\n\nThere was the situation where the native band in British Columbia ended up taking money that was supposed to be used for child care study and using it to buy jewels. It is unbelievable. That is what happens when we give a Liberal government a bunch of money and an open chequebook to do with what it will. That is precisely what happens.\n\nWhat I am concerned about, and I think Canadians are concerned about, is that a culture of neglect runs right through this government.\n\nInterestingly enough it was the human resources minister who was previously the Indian affairs minister. On her watch the auditor general came before parliament to present his report. Over and over and over again were all kinds of examples of how the government was not monitoring money that was going to Indian bands. There was example after example. Did anything change? Have things changed? Obviously not.\n\nThere is another example in today's newspapers of what has gone on. It is absolutely shameful.\n\nThe question is what do we do in a situation like this? The very first thing is that we exorcise the cancer. We get it out of there. Do we know who that is? It is the minister, the previous minister and probably the minister previous to that one. Three ministers in a row sat there knowing that this was going on and allowed that $1 billion to be spent year after year after year with no proper accounting. Meanwhile high priority things are left wanting.\n\nConsider national defence. We send people around the world to do all kinds of great and honourable things and put their lives on the line without proper equipment. The government is blowing $1 billion a year out the door. It is absolutely unbelievable but the government sits and justifies it.\n\nI heard the minister with her pathetic justifications today. It was unbelievable. She said, “Well you know, some of it goes to things that are really good”. Well, guess what. We know that. We know there are some things out there that if they had some money it would be good. We do not question that.\n\nWe question which ones should get the money and where that money should come from. Should it come from big daddy government in Ottawa 2,000 miles away from all these projects, or should it come from local levels of government and private individuals? I would argue it should come from the latter because those are the people who know which programs are most important in their ridings. They know what they can afford because they are the taxpayers.\n\nWhen we have a government that coercively takes money from people and we have the highest personal income taxes in the western world, and it hurts my friends across the way when we point these facts out and they are painful, rather obviously in a situation like that people would like to have the choice.\n\nI have no doubt that Canadians being as generous as they are, they would overwhelmingly support worthy programs. They would. What they resent is a government that reaches into their pockets, drives taxes through the roof to the point where we have the highest taxes in Canadian history, and then wastes their money.\n\nThis is one department. I would love to peel open the books on those other departments because I know we would find the same thing in myriad other departments.\n\nI encourage my friends across the way to climb down off their high horses and admit they are wrong. The minister should resign. Probably the previous two ministers should resign. Maybe then Canadians would start to have some faith that the government actually cares about what it does with people's money. I do not think they believe that now. They have seen too many examples of waste and cover-up and mismanagement from the government.\n\nI will close by saying that very shortly there will be another budget. I hope that the finance minister does not have the gall to ask Canadians for more money to increase spending. Rather obviously, there are billions of dollars of waste in the government, yet my friends across the way do nothing to root it out and to save taxpayers a lot of money.\n\nI encourage the minister to heed the message to clean up the waste and mismanagement before he asks for one more cent in the next budget.",

            "text": "moved:\n\nThat the Standing Committee on Industry review policies currently in place that affect the Canadian shipbuilding industry in order to assess their ability to provide a competitive and equitable environment for growth of the industry in Canada.\n\nMadam Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to rise in this place to discuss a very important issue which I believe is critical to the economic well-being of the country and in particular Atlantic Canada.\n\nI rise today as a member of parliament for the riding of Fundy—Royal which borders the city of Saint John. I am one of many members of parliament who have spoken in this place over the last number of years to put forth the need for us to modernize our current shipbuilding policy.\n\nMembers from all sides of the House have spoken on behalf of this initiative. It has a wide breadth of support from a number of political parties, for example the New Democrats, and a hot and cold relationship with the Liberals. The member from Lévis, Quebec, has been a strong advocate of the need to revitalize our shipbuilding policy.\n\nNo member in the House of Commons has fought more tirelessly than the member for Saint John to ensure that the people of Saint John, New Brunswick, are able to earn their living at the shipyard located there and that Saint John Shipbuilding Limited will work again. The member for Saint John has spoken in the House on countless occasions, whether it be during debate or in question period. I rise today on behalf of all individuals who are trying to advance this debate.\n\nMotion No. 71 calls on the Standing Committee on Industry to complete an indepth review and analysis of current shipbuilding policies and how they affect the growth or lack thereof of the shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe motion does not compel the government to make any changes. It only requests that the industry committee assess the current system for its ability to promote growth in the Canadian shipbuilding industry. Put simply, it proposes that the committee complete an indepth review of the file.\n\nI will talk about what we need to do to revitalize our shipbuilding as has been advocated by an unprecedented number of individuals. Only last March the motion put forward by the member for Saint John on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada called on the House to develop a national shipbuilding policy. At the same time the member for Saint John utilized the exact same language the Liberal Party of Canada used on two separate occasions to put forward a resolution by its members at its national convention concerning the need for us to develop a national shipbuilding policy. At that time in the House the Liberal government chose to reject that initiative. I find this a bit shocking.\n\nI have a document with me which I hesitate to use as a prop by any means. It is entitled “Atlantic Canada: Catching Tomorrow's Wave”. I do not know if members have had a chance to review this document, but on page 104 it notes that one of the critical initiatives needed to develop a modern economy in Atlantic Canada is a new shipbuilding policy. Maybe the Liberals are actually listening to the member for Saint John, to me and to all other individuals who have put forth this point.\n\nPage 106 goes on to say that Canada is the only country which does not provide any direct construction grants, loan guarantees, preferential rate export financing, research and development grants, preferential tax treatment or customs duties on imported ship materials.\n\nThat document was produced by Liberal Party members from Atlantic Canada, what few it might actually have. A number of them were able to coalesce to put together a document on September 30, 1999, less than six months after they turned their nose down on trying to advance the debate we had put forward back in March.\n\nI am advocating something that is almost unprecedented. These individuals are calling for us to modernize the shipbuilding industry. They represented all 10 premiers of this great country of Canada not just once but on two separate occasions: in St. Andrews in 1997 and again in Quebec City in 1998. All 10 provinces have actually put their shoulder to the wheel and said that we need to ensure we have the financial instruments to develop a shipbuilding policy.\n\nIn addition to all 10 premiers, the ship owners, the shipbuilders and labour have coalesced around the same principles and are advocating the exact same things that we need to modernize our shipbuilding industry.\n\nBefore I go into the actual issues in terms of what I am advocating the Department of Industry and the Minister of Industry bring forward, I want to make it very clear to everybody in this place today or watching at home on CPAC that we are not looking for subsidies in any way, shape or form for the shipbuilding industry. We are looking for the government to do two principal things. One is to give it sound, viable access to its market and the other is to provide a proper tax regime for it to be able to compete.\n\nSound and viable access to its market for most commodities might be roads, rails and other direct infrastructure like ports and airports, for that matter. We have those challenges near my home in the riding of Saint John. That is normally the kind of infrastructure we speak about.\n\nAnother role in terms of what we are looking at in terms of a sound, viable access to its market is an international trade regime so that it actually has a marketplace in which to establish. I will come back to that in a few moments as I progress through the course of the debate.\n\nWe also need to develop an international tax regime whereby we can be competitive in Canada. The corporate taxes in Canada are completely uncompetitive in other regimes. In fact, Canada has the second highest corporate taxes in the industrialized world, second only to Japan. It is difficult for any industry to compete and make a profit in Canada, in particular the shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe four points I will advocate would be the cornerstone for developing a modern shipbuilding policy supported by all 10 premiers, labour, ship owners and shipbuilders. I know the member for Saint John can attest to them as well as every family, every man and woman who actually has earned a paycheque in shipyards whether it be in Saint John, New Brunswick; Marystown, Newfoundland; Port Weller, Ontario; Lévis, Quebec; or elsewhere throughout the country. These are the initiatives we are looking at doing.\n\nFirst and foremost, we understand categorically that any time a large capital good is purchased in Canada or anywhere in the world the available financial package is a cornerstone of whether or not the bid is competitive. That means access to capital at the most aggressive financing rates possible. That is why we are advocating that a loan guarantee program be adopted similar to the one in the American title XI program which guarantees under very prudent criteria the loan of a potential ship buyer.\n\nThe title XI program has been in place place since 1936. Do members know how many loan defaults it has had since then? The member for Saint John knows the answer. The answer is zip, zero, not one loan default. If a student in university copied something and got in trouble it was called plagiarism. In the real world, if it works it is called being resourceful. I am advocating that Canada develop a loan guarantee program similar to the one in title XI and adopt it in the Canadian context.\n\nWe have a natural vehicle to deliver that in the departments of industry and international trade, the Export Development Corporation. It will guarantee a loan for a foreign buyer of a ship. We also need to adapt it to guarantee a loan for a domestic buyer of a ship, especially given the fact that we have a aging fleet on the Great Lakes, one of our principal markets in terms of where we can build ships on a competitive basis in Canada.\n\nThe second point I am advocating is that our punitive tax regime in Canada needs to provide accelerated depreciation combined with revising Revenue Canada leasing regulations. Lease financing has become a very natural vehicle for purchases of large capital goods. We need to ensure that our tax regime is competitive with that of the United States. I am not looking at subsidies. I am looking at a loan guarantee program. I am looking at changing the Canadian tax regime.\n\nThe third point I am advocating is that we need to ensure that we find sound, viable access to our markets. I spoke about the need for a trade regime. The result of the free trade agreement, NAFTA, in general has been very positive for Canada. Prior to 1988 we traded essentially $80 billion each year with the Americans. Today we trade around $240 billion to $260 billion each year with the Americans.\n\nHowever, the Jones Act which has been in place in the United States since 1936 has blocked our penetration into the American market. That is fine to some degree. We can compete if we have a proper tax regime and a proper loan guarantee program with the markets in the EU. We can build ships in our own waters and on the Great Lakes.\n\nIt is incumbent on the government, the Minister for International Trade and the Minister of Industry, to step forward and talk with the Americans about opening up some kind of bilateral accord on building certain types of ships. The example of offshore drilling rigs comes to mind. The member for Saint John and I have spoken about it on countless occasions. There is an actual demand for more capacity to build drilling rigs for development off the banks of Newfoundland in the Terra Nova, Hibernia, Ben Nevis and White Rose oilfields, in terms of the development that has taken place along the Carolinas and what we have seen in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWe could develop shipshape drilling rigs, which are in demand with the States, and we could open up a bilateral accord in that way. Maybe we should look at ocean-going tugs, which are manufactured in P.E.I. In Georgetown, P.E.I., in the solicitor general's riding, they manufacture a very cost-competitive ship. Maybe we could develop a bilateral accord in that area.\n\nWhat we are looking at is a loan guarantee program similar to what the Americans have under Title XI, revising our leasing regulations so we have a competitive tax regime and opening up some form of bilateral accord.\n\nI heard, sadly, in the House on a number of occasions the government say “You, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, negotiated the free trade agreement and at that time you missed out on an opportunity to ensure that shipbuilding was exempt from any kind of protectionist regime under the free trade agreement”. I would like to remind every one of those members, categorically, that free trade has been a win for Canada. In 1988 our trade with the Americans amounted to $80 billion. Today it is around $240 billion.\n\nThe government has been in office for almost seven years and it has not knocked on the door of one congressman or one senator in the United States of America to say that maybe it is time we actually tried to do something in that regard.\n\nThe problem with this issue is that there is no leadership in advancing the file. This is where I am at a loss. The Minister of Finance says that it is not his file. The Minister for International Trade says that the EDC is under his jurisdiction but it is not really his file, that it comes under the industry file. The Minister of Industry says that the instruments we are looking for belong in other jurisdictions.\n\nIf we do not have a quarterback in place who is willing to advance the shipbuilding industry in this country, then it is time we change the quarterback. We should change the Minister of Industry so that we can ensure we get people back to work in Atlantic Canada, in Quebec, in Vancouver and in Ontario.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise to respond to Motion No. 71 presented by the hon. member from the Tory party. The motion calls for the Standing Committee on Industry to review the policies in place which affect the Canadian shipbuilding industry in order to assess their ability to provide a competitive and equitable environment for the growth of the industry in Canada.\n\nThis is a noble cause. Canadians want to sympathize with the hon. member who laments the days when Canada was one of the great shipbuilding nations.\n\nLower taxes would help all factors of our economy. If the government would lower taxes it would help our industries. Lower taxes would help all companies across the country.\n\nThe official opposition policy calls for private sector self-reliance without the federal government providing tax dollars to support any specific sector.\n\nLet us look at the shipbuilding industry in Canada. With only .04%, that is 1/25th of a percentage point of the world's shipbuilding production, Canada cannot sustain a shipbuilding industry. Rather than try to match these subsidies and other incentives offered by other countries, we should concentrate our efforts on negotiating down unfair export subsidies.\n\nFar from guaranteeing loans to Canadians who purchase Canadian built ships, we should drop the 25% tariff we have on non-NAFTA ship imports so that all Canadian shipowners and ship purchasers are not penalized.\n\nIndustry Canada can tell us about the problems in the shipbuilding industry. It is a declining industry, a dead in the water industry. There is an overcapacity in the world of over 40%. Canada is not even in the ballpark.\n\nWhat the Liberals and Tories have done to the shipbuilding industry in Canada is a study on what not to do in terms of productivity. Yet the industry department continues to have a shipbuilding policy which has technology partnership grants, research and development grants and the Export Development Corporation supporting it. Why?\n\nThe technology partnerships program is available to firms for research and development, if they so wish. It is repayable based on success. It is a risk sharing, reward sharing program. No one should use this program for shipbuilding because there would be no way to pay back the loan.\n\nLet us look at the world shipbuilding industry. This industry has moved away from North American and European markets to southeast Asian markets. Japan and South Korea continue to control over two-thirds of the total international market for shipbuilding and ship repair. China is emerging as a rival. When combined, these three countries control over 75% of the world market.\n\nDue to extreme pressure from Asian shipbuilders many traditional shipbuilders, including the Norwegian company Kvaerner, have chosen to get out of the industry altogether.\n\nCanada cannot build major ships. We can manufacture only minor and smaller vessels here. Both of these markets are already operating at over 40% of their capacity. Demand and prices are already weak and are forecast to continue to decline. Prices for 1999 are down by 6% to 24% from last year.\n\nThe international market is experiencing a significant downsizing. Market conditions for shipbuilders are not about to change. The total employment in Canada's shipbuilding and ship repair industry as of May 1999 was about 5,000.\n\nWhat should be done? We should not turn to taxpayers and make them pay for a shipbuilding industry in Canada that will never be a viable industry. On this side of the House we support de-politicizing economic decision making by eliminating grants, guarantees and subsidies.\n\nWhat did the Tories do about the shipbuilding industry when they were in power for nine years? The destruction of the shipbuilding industry during their time in government was devastating to our eastern provinces and to B.C.\n\nLet us look at subsidies as a solution. The Tories think, as the Liberals do, that all we have to do is get the industry committee to approve millions of dollars worth of subsidies and we can resurrect Canada's shipbuilding industry. That is typical. The Liberals use the industry committee and its minister to try to give millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds to hockey teams. This is all very disgusting to those of us who are building an alternative to the traditional way of doing things here in Ottawa.\n\nIn the last session the House debated shipbuilding. A Bloc MP wanted to establish a federal loan granting program that would cover up to 87.5% of the money borrowed to purchase a commercial ship built in Canadian shipyards. That bill would also have provided a favourable and generous tax treatment of lease financing for the purchase of Canadian built ships. The Bloc MP's bill proposed a refundable tax credit for refitting commercial ships in Canada. This was not just another attempt to do some Liberal bashing over this issue; maybe the Bloc Quebecois also wants Canadian taxpayers to continue pouring millions of taxpayer dollars into Quebec up to the last minute, until they leave Canada, but it is very clear that the people of Quebec will not be following the Bloc Quebecois anywhere.\n\nLet us look at the industry committee. In November of last year the industry committee dealt with the shipbuilding matter. The committee heard the sad details of the worldwide industry, which spelled poor prospects in the industry for our country in the future.\n\nThe Liberals on the committee did not know or were not willing to admit that their minister for the homeless was secretly lobbying cabinet, trying to broker a common ground between industry and the government. Canadians think that she is in Toronto working on the homeless problem. We know that she is not in B.C. helping Vancouver with its homeless people. The media caught her working on shipbuilding. The Liberals only want to meet to talk about helping the shipbuilding industry. This garners votes in eastern Canada and Quebec, and they hope in B.C.\n\nThe government could be wrong, but it does not want to have to face Canadian taxpayers and our foreign trading partners with the facts and figures on actually how much money it would pour into the industry. That is a big question.\n\nThis is the same government that cannot account for $1 billion in HRDC spending, which we were debating earlier today. The concentration on this issue could be construed as a thinly veiled attempt to orchestrate the immediate building of five or six ships which the federal government plans to construct in four or five years. We are watching for an attempt to have these ships built this year or next. This may save the taxpayers money or it may not. Maybe the ships could be built cheaper offshore. That would save taxpayers some money. Let us look at a viable solution. Maybe the Liberals will have these ships constructed just before the next federal election so they can throw the industry a bone. No one will be fooled.\n\nI will support the review of the shipbuilding policy. However, I will support it reluctantly.\n\nThe questions are: How many times do we have to review this matter? How much money is it going to cost taxpayers? Canadians know that the current Liberal government is maintaining a high, artificial level of taxation. It is hurting our economy, our productivity and our growth with high taxes, as the member from the PC party mentioned. It is hurting our consumers and it is discouraging foreign investors from coming to Canada. It has caused a brain drain that threatens our country.\n\nSomething has to be done about the high level of taxes that is killing jobs, our economy, our industry and the country. Our employment levels are too low. With our vast resources and our ability to create wealth with other nations in the global economy—",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to speak to the motion moved by the member for Fundy—Royal in New Brunswick.\n\nI say pleasure, because this member, along with certain others, has long been calling for a real shipbuilding policy.\n\nBefore I address the motion, I have a few comments about the speech by the Reform Party member. I was somewhat taken aback because I have been on the Standing Committee on Industry since the 1997 election, and I noticed that the party is on its third industry critic. The first two shared our vision, but all of a sudden, perhaps seeing the possibility of political gain in their fight with the Progressive Conservatives for a certain percentage of the voters, they are switching their position.\n\nI want to point out to the Reform Party member who has just spoken and who is not listening to me—but I will say it again—that 20 members of his party supported my Bill C-213 just a few months ago. So some consistency is called for on the Reform Party side.\n\nNow, I will return to the motion by the member for the Progressive Conservative Party, the member for Fundy—Royal. His motion made sense and perhaps still does. What he was calling for at the time was for the issue to be considered by the Standing Committee on Industry.\n\nThere were at least three sittings of the Standing Committee on Industry where we met with Department of Industry officials. In response to a question by a Reform member, a deputy minister replied that the Reform member was wrong, that the federal government had no particular policy on shipbuilding and that the member could rest assured that no more was being done for that sector than for any other. I then rose to say “That is exactly where the problem lies. You are doing nothing in particular for this sector. You have abandoned it”.\n\nYet that party had committed, in its red book and in 1993, to hold, within a year of its election, a summit on the future of shipbuilding in Canada. Since then, nothing.\n\nA little later on, management and the unions appeared before the committee. We asked the unions “Do you feel that there is a shipbuilding policy in Canada?” They said there was not. Then we asked management “Do you feel that there is a policy?” They said “Yes, there is the customs duty”. Clearly the CEO of the Shipbuilding Association did not want to overly displease the Liberal Party. He said “Yes, there are certain policies, including the customs duty” but that is all.\n\nOver and over again I asked “Do you feel that you have a true shipbuilding policy?” In the bill we are going to address tomorrow evening, moreover, the three measures I am referring to are the three ones being requested. I stated further “You are supported in this by the unions, by the Chambre maritime du Canada, by the provincial premiers. You have the support of 150,000 people who sent a mail-in postcard to the Prime Minister. You even have the support of members of the Liberal Party of Canada who are holding their convention.” Some Liberal members attending the convention voted with the grassroots, urging their government to act.\n\nThe Minister of Labour tried to do something. She appointed a delegate to the Maritimes to look into the matter. The Reform Party member noticed and he criticized the minister for it, telling her “You should not have done that. You did that in secret”. As for the Minister of Industry, he did not want to do anything, while the Minister of Finance could not do a thing. That has always been his line.\n\nWhy can the Minister of Finance not act? He will not tell the House. He lets the Minister of Industry answer, but we are asking for tax measures. Outside the House, the Minister of Finance says “You see, I have some interests in the shipbuilding industry. These interests are now in a trust, but I cannot answer. I would not want to be seen as someone who wants to promote that sector because I happen to have some interests in that particular sector”.\n\nThings are not good when the one person who could do something does not dare do so for fear of being criticized. When she saw that her industry colleague was not acting, and even though this was not her responsibility, the Minister of Labour tried to do something, but the Reform Party member criticized her for it.\n\nI want the Minister of Labour to know that she did well, as did her colleague from New Brunswick. She wants to look into the matter. I have nothing against that, but we have been asking for reviews for seven years. The industry got organized and conducted a review. The Standing Committee on Industry considered the issue from a productivity point of view.\n\nFigures in hand, the unions appeared before the committee to testify that Canadian shipyard workers were paid 20% less than their American counterparts, and 50% less than workers in Germany and Japan. Only two countries, Korea and communist China, pay their shipyard workers less, and that is the example the Reform Party member would have us follow.\n\nThere are people who claim to be experts on the shipbuilding industry while never having set foot in a shipyard. I would like the Reform Party member to try this line in Halifax or Vancouver, where there are two large shipyards. Or he could try out the audience in Lévis. He would be well-advised to pre-record his press conference because he is going to run into trouble.\n\nThis position is indefensible and inconsistent with the earlier positions taken by the Reform Party. Now it is trying to teach us a lesson about free enterprise. All they are trying to do is lower individual income taxes.\n\nThe member for Fundy—Royal told us that Canadian corporate taxes, which take in shipyards, are among the highest. That is one of the problems. Why do Canadian shipowners have their boats built outside Canada? Why do those people who have had ships built sometimes sail them under foreign flags? Because corporate taxes are not the same everywhere in the world, and there are tax havens. The Minister of Finance knows this. He chairs a committee of members of the group of 20 and he should give this some thought. That is the problem, not what workers are paid.\n\nThe problem is a serious lack of guaranteed financing. No one here in this House is asking for funding. The Reformers keep saying it, and the member himself keeps saying that the member from the Bloc is asking for a refundable tax credit. The words mean what they mean: refundable. It is not funding. A loan guarantee is not funding, it is support.\n\nIs the Reform Party, which is trying to copy the American program, trying all the time to tell us that things are better in the United States? What is called for in Bill C-213 is exactly what the Americans have been doing for the past 100 years. We in Canada are doing what? We are exempting the U.S. from paying 25% duty. However, our Canadian shipowners cannot go to the United States, because of the protectionist measures.\n\nThe member for Fundy—Royal said “We have to look at that. It cannot be included in a bill”. It is not in my bill either because the Minister for International Trade is the one to go and negotiate some similar measure with his American counterpart or a change to NAFTA—and that is very difficult—or have the Jones act amended to exempt Canada from such a policy. If this were the case, with the current rate of exchange there would be work in Canadian shipyards, incredibly more than Canada could generate.\n\nI recently did a study on the Internet and by phone. In the United States, shipyards are currently working at full tilt. The remaining European shipyards are also working to capacity because following the Asian crisis the Asian shipyards are not working at full capacity.\n\nThe Reform member does not know what he is talking about when he speaks as other detractors of the shipping industry. He said that China, Korea and Japan are building 500,000 tonne boats. No Canadian shipyard is in that league. They do not go beyond 100,000 tonnes. Why? Because they build ships that have to go through the Panama Canal which will accept nothing over 90,000 tonnes. So, let us compare oranges with oranges and apples with apples. If you do not know what you are talking about, better not to speak.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, first, I wish to praise the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for being so passionate and caring for the shipbuilding industry in this country. There is no member of parliament who has worked harder on this issue for workers in the shipbuilding industry all across the country. He, his party and the Conservative Party should be congratulated for bringing this motion forward. I applaud their efforts in bringing this to the forefront and to debate in the House of Commons.\n\nI will begin by saying that I am wearing the CAW/MWF pin from the Marine Workers' Federation. Mr. Les Holloway and all those wonderful people in Halifax, in Saint John and in other shipyards around the area have worked tirelessly on this issue to get the government to listen. What this nation needs is a shipbuilding policy. Holland, Italy, England and the United States have one but we do not. If we did, it would be working.\n\nWe constantly hear from the industry minister that there is an overcapacity in the industry, yet Canada only produces .4%. What the industry has been asking for is that the level be brought up to 1%, a .6% increase, in order to create and sustain thousands of jobs in Atlantic Canada, Ontario, Quebec and Vancouver.\n\nIt is incredible that the government will not listen. It is absolutely unbelievable. The reason it does not listen is because its focus is between Windsor and Quebec City in terms of central Canadian thinking.\n\nWe have a farming crisis and the recent fisheries crisis but the government refuses to listen to the extremities of the country.\n\nI say, in all honesty, that any time we have a labour leader like Buzz Hargrove and the owner of one of the largest shipyards in the country, J.D. Irving, singing out of the same hymn book on this policy, one would think that the government would grab at that, but it does not. It absolutely ignores the issue.\n\nI honestly believe the government does not understand the industry at all. It is completely blank. It is like a deer caught in the headlights of a car. It just cannot figure it out.\n\nThe member for Fundy—Royal mentioned the book Atlantic Canada: Catching Tomorrow's Wave . Unfortunately, the government missed the boat on this one. It is unbelievable.\n\nWe had the appointment of Senator Boudreau from Nova Scotia who is now in the Senate draining the taxpayers' purse promoting this red book wherever he goes. The problem is that he has absolutely no clout with the government. If he did, the government would be listening to everyone on the shipbuilding policy.\n\nThere was a great book written recently by a great author in Nova Scotia who lives in my riding, Mr. Lesley Choyce. He wrote a book entitled Nova Scotia: Shaped by the Sea: A Living History . In it, he describes how Nova Scotia was one of the finest and largest shipbuilding provinces in the 18th and 19th centuries. What has happened in this new millennium? The thing has fallen apart. Why? Because the government refuses to institute a policy of fairness so we can keep workers in this country.\n\nAs we speak, shipbuilding workers from the Saint John dockyards are being lured to the United States to build ships. It is unbelievable that the United States has such an overcapacity of work that it has to get Canadian workers, who are the best in the world when it comes to building ships, to build ships in the United States. We could easily be doing that in the yards of Saint John, Halifax, Marystown, Lévis and Vancouver.\n\nIt is amazing that the government cannot figure this out. Hundreds of workers are leaving this country and their families behind to build ships in the United States when the work could be easily done in this country. It is absolutely incredible that the government would ignore the needs of Atlantic Canadians, Quebecers and British Columbians when it comes to building a shipbuilding industry.\n\nI find it scandalous, to the highest degree, when I hear where the finance minister, who has Canada Steamship Lines, has his ships built. Where does he have his ships built?",

What will happen then? Oh, I know, there will be a traditional transitional jobs fund grant. That should be good. Maybe that is what the problem is.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry should go to the human resources minister for money and grants. That way it would not have to file any papers or anything. It could get the money or whatever it needs right away. Maybe that is what the NHL should have done. Instead of going to the industry minister it should have gone to the human resources minister. There is all kinds of money for those initiatives but absolutely not one shred of concern for this country's shipbuilding industry and that is an absolute disgrace.\n\nI could go on and on.

They are asking the government to listen to them, to work together with the industry, the communities and the workers to come up with a comprehensive policy that will make the shipbuilding industry what it once was in Canada.

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I thank you for your clarification. Let me get to the essence of the whole debate here tonight.\n\nI remind the House that last November and December the Standing Committee on Industry had already begun reviewing Canada's productivity and competitiveness with respect to shipbuilding. I want to make it crystal clear that the member's motion comes a little bit too late, as I said earlier. Let me emphasize the valuable work already done by the Standing Committee on Industry.\n\nBefore taking a few moments to review the testimony provided during the hearings, I want to once again remind all members that there is a national shipbuilding policy in Canada and it includes the following support. They said there is no shipbuilding industry. There is an accelerated capital cost allowance for Canadian built ships; a 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA ship imports; domestic procurement by the federal government in the hundreds of millions of dollars; Export Development Corporation financing for commercially viable transactions; and a very favourable research and development tax credit system.\n\nThese are the very elements that the industry committee has examined. On November 16, the first day, the committee heard from several government officials. Committee members were provided with a global portrait of the shipbuilding industry. We have to look at it in that context, one in which most shipbuilding today is done in Asia, Japan, South Korea and increasingly I might point out in China. These governments heavily subsidize the sector.\n\nThe Japanese have built a strong niche in the construction of large vessels and have managed to hold on to that niche. The newly developed countries see shipbuilding as an outlet for their steel production and steel production is a key to their industrial development. Other countries, including the United States, have non-tariff barriers to buying foreign built ships.\n\nOfficials also maintain that overcapacity has been a problem for Canada's shipbuilding industry today. For some time now the industry has been undergoing rationalization. Officials have suggested that the industry itself acknowledges that rationalization has improved its competitiveness.\n\nOn a more positive note, officials pointed out in committee that the Canadian manufacturers are on a par with just about everyone in the world when it comes to designing innovative products, manufacturing them efficiently and marketing them to the world. They said that there are niche opportunities for the Canadian shipbuilding industry. Ice-breaking vessels, ferries, offshore equipment and self-unloading vessels are areas in which we have a great international reputation. We are also well regarded as builders of military frigates. Unfortunately there is not that big of a market for them.\n\nOfficials from the Export Development Corporation also appeared before the committee. They reported that EDC has concluded 17 transactions with the shipbuilding industry for a total of $247 million worth in business. Here is one government program which indeed is showing a positive result.\n\nFinance officials also explained how Canada's tax system supports shipbuilding, including giving the industry a higher capital cost allowance and noted that Canada has the most generous R and D regime in the G-7.\n\nDuring the hearings the hon. member for Fundy—Royal referred to the financing available in the United States under the title XI program. I remind the hon. member for Fundy—Royal of his exchange with the finance officials concerning his suggestion that Canada should provide a combination of lease financing and accelerated depreciation. The hon. member also may believe that in providing these incentives the government would end up increasing federal revenues because there would be more economic activity. Finance officials clearly pointed out in their reply that rarely does the government's return on such incentives amount to more than a fraction of the amount of taxpayer moneys committed.\n\nThese are some of the points raised in the first day of the standing committee's hearings on shipbuilding. As you can tell, Madam Speaker, we had a vigorous and exciting debate during that session.\n\nThe standing committee went on to hear testimony from labour organizations including the Canadian auto workers, the Marine Workers' Federation of the CAW and the ship workers union of Lauzon. We were presented with a document entitled “The Shipbuilding Strategy for Canada” which talked about the need for a level playing field, emphasizing the role of the Jones Act in the United States in closing its markets to Canadian built ships. They offered suggestions including financing terms that would be similar to what the Americans have with their title XI program. Once again the committee had a very probing, thought provoking exchange with the shipbuilding industry.\n\nOn December 14 the standing committee met for a third time on the topic of shipbuilding to hear from industry representatives. The Shipbuilding Association of Canada spoke of the impact of subsidies on the market and the need for competitive financing arrangements. He referred specifically to the title XI financing of the American shipbuilding industry. The Chamber of Maritime Commerce spoke also about the advantages that labour practices and low labour rates give the shipbuilding industry in newly developed countries.\n\nI would like to close by thanking the member for bringing forward the motion and giving us the opportunity to debate this issue in the House and the opportunity for the government to put some of the data on the floor.",

The member from Lévis has been a champion for advancing the cause to have a modern shipbuilding policy that actually works compared to the one which we currently have that does not work.\n\nHowever, my greatest compliments go to the member for Surrey Central for what he essentially has done for me in the riding of Fundy—Royal. He has augmented my vote by about eight to ten per cent. He categorically said this evening that the shipbuilding industry in Canada is dead. That was the cornerstone of his debate.

I know Reformers are not real Conservatives by any means. They do not understand what tax reduction is in that regard.\n\nTo my colleagues in the Liberal Party of Canada, I know that they categorically want to help individuals. We are not asking them to spend any amount of money, but I have to remind the hon. member who spoke on behalf of the Liberal government that its own members from Atlantic Canada are advocating the need to improve its shipbuilding policy that is incentive based, not subsidy driven, so that we can get those men and women back to work.\n\nAbove all, perhaps the thing I am most shocked about is the very fact that every single time we have had a shipbuilding motion before the House they have never permitted on any occasion any member from the Liberal caucus who has a seat in Atlantic Canada to actually participate in the debate. I wonder why that is. Is it because the Minister of Industry is blocking it?\n\nI know that the member from Moncton, the Minister of Labour, really wants to advance this particular debate. In order to do so I would hope that she participates in the debate tomorrow. We are going to be debating shipbuilding again with respect to the private members' motion by the hon. member from Lévis. What we are doing today from a shipbuilding perspective is not working. We have an unprecedented coalition of individuals who are looking for tax reduction, not subsidies, to modernize the shipbuilding industry.\n\nWe have had Reform members flip flop. This is nothing new for them. Two or three Reform members came to committee to say they support what we were doing. Then they came to the House and said that they did not support it. They cannot make up their minds. Maybe in tomorrow's debate we will get a new Reform speech and have a new perspective in that regard.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to this motion and to tell the House and those people at home who may be watching why the motion is important and should be supported by the House. I am referring to a motion that would require the Government of Canada to toughen up the privacy commission's role and responsibility in safeguarding the rights of Canadians and their right to privacy.\n\nEvery Canadian citizen has the right to the security of the person under our charter of rights and freedoms. It is my contention, and I think most if not all members of the House would agree, that the security of the person would include the security of the private information held by government institutions or other institutions which could in some way jeopardize or prejudice the individual if the private information were to be distributed among the public.\n\nMost sensitive and private information on Canadian citizens is held by government institutions. We should think about the tremendous amount of information Revenue Canada has on each and every one of us as taxpayers and about all other information held by government in terms of birth certificates, marriage certificates and so on which the government routinely collects from us in one way or another, largely through Revenue Canada. Revenue Canada is the institution most people would be most concerned about because it concerns financial matters, but there are other matters as well.\n\nA federal body of legislation known as the Privacy Act safeguards the privacy of Canadian citizens. The privacy commissioner and his office were established to oversee the administration of that act, to receive complaints from Canadians when they feel their privacy or their right to privacy has been violated, to investigate those complaints, and to make determinations on whether or not those allegations are well founded.\n\nThe Privacy Act is a good idea. As a matter fact it is absolutely imperative to have the Privacy Act, the privacy commissioner and his office to field complaints from Canadian citizens, to investigate those complaints, to make determinations and to discharge those complaints to the best of their ability. I take no issue with the privacy commission or the privacy commissioner.\n\nThe issue we are dealing with today is not that the Privacy Act is deficient in the sense of defining a person's rights, what private information ought to be held as private, and how government, financial and private institutions ought to act with respect to information that is sensitive or is considered to be private.\n\nThe problem we face right now is the Privacy Act has no teeth in it. In other words we have a body of legislation, and it is absolutely correct, which protects the rights of Canadian citizens and to safeguard their privacy and their right to privacy. However, if anyone violates that act, even if the violations are wilful or intended to prejudice the individual or individuals involved, there are absolutely no penalties contained within the body of the Privacy Act.\n\nI ask members to reflect on how ludicrous that is. It is the same as having laws that govern how we drive our vehicles. We have posted speed limits and laws on how we conduct ourselves on the road when we operate motor vehicles. For example, it is against the law to be operating a motor vehicle if one is impaired. In most places in Canada it is against the law to operate a motor vehicle without wearing a seat belt. It is against the law to be driving faster than posted speed limits. It is against the law to disobey stop signs. There are penalties attached to each and every one of those laws and regulations. The penalties more or less reflect the severity of the violation or the potential violation of each of those regulations or laws.\n\nHuman nature being what it is and human beings being what they are, we can only expect people to behave in a certain way when there is a real deterrent for them if they violate the laws upon which society is based. In the instance of the Privacy Act where there are no penalties or downside to violating the act, how can any Canadian citizen feel good about expecting the privacy laws to protect him or her?\n\nI will tell the House how the lack of protection within the Privacy Act first came to my attention. A couple of years ago a fellow in Alberta by the name of Bruce Starlight, an aboriginal person living on the Tsuu T'ina reserve, wrote a private letter to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that was not circulated to anyone else. In his two page letter he made a number of observations and allegations with respect to financial mismanagement on his reserve. In her capacity as the minister responsible for that department he asked her to investigate and determine whether or not what he was alleging was true. Mr. Starlight did not receive a response to his letter from the minister.\n\nAbout two and a half or three months later he received a knock on his door one night. It was somebody serving him legal notice that he was being sued for defamation for making allegations against his chief and council. Part of the evidence of his allegedly making defamatory allegations against the chief and council was the letter he had written to the minister with her actual office stamp on it.\n\nThat private letter was received in her office in Ottawa. To this day we still do not the exact trail, but it was handed back to the chief and council against whom the band member was making allegations. It put Mr. Starlight in a very difficult situation.\n\nHe contacted me, as a member of parliament and as critic for Indian affairs and northern development, and asked for my assistance. He asked “Is the government wallowed to do that? If I write a letter to a minister, which is considered to be a private matter, is the minister allowed to circulate my letter to anyone in a way that may possibly prejudice me, my family and my position in my community?”\n\nWe contacted the privacy commissioner and the privacy commission on Mr. Starlight's behalf and posed the same question. We asked the privacy commissioner to investigate. I have to tell the House and anyone out there who is listening that we received absolute co-operation from the privacy commissioner's office and from the privacy commissioner himself. We were very pleased with the way they responded to our requests. We were very pleased with the way they conducted an investigation. We are very pleased with the fact that at the end of the day they did come back to us and to Mr. Starlight. They concluded in a very substantial way that Mr. Starlight's privacy had been compromised very badly by the minister of Indian affairs and her department. The minister of that day is currently the minister for HRDC.\n\nThe privacy commissioner also advised us at the time that although there was a violation of privacy there was no penalty. There was no recourse for Mr. Starlight at all. The fact that he was put in a very difficult situation and in a position of financial hardship because he ended up having to partly finance a legal suit out of his own pocket did not give him any recourse whatsoever to go back and initiate any kind of action against the minister of Indian affairs and/or her department.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the privacy commissioner determined that there were at least 61 or 62 people within the minister's department and the higher echelons of the department of Indian affairs that had access to Mr. Starlight's letter. The privacy commissioner determined that it would be virtually impossible to determine the actual culprit or culprits in the violation of Mr. Starlight's privacy, short of getting honest and truthful statements from people who were involved, which I gather were not forthcoming.\n\nThe privacy commissioner made a number of recommendations to the department and to the minister for instituting better security surrounding correspondence. The minister and the department made public statements that they would take the privacy commissioner's advice and tighten up security.\n\nIn the meantime that does not help Mr. Starlight. It does not send the right message to government institutions when they see a minister and a minister's office in blatant violation of the law with absolutely no penalty to be paid in a milieu—and it has been patently obvious for the last few days that this is very true—where ministers of the crown routinely refuse to take responsibility for their departments and the bungling that goes on. The minister in question in this case, who is now the minister of HRDC, in my estimation is incapable of taking responsibility simply because she is not a capable minister. She is not in charge and never has been in charge of any department over which she has been given responsibility. What recourse do Canadian citizens have in that kind of milieu where nobody wants to take responsibility, in a situation where the privacy commissioner says that there were 62 people who had access to that letter and nobody has taken responsibility, and the minister responsible for the department is not taking responsibility?\n\nThere must be teeth in this legislation. There must be a penalty attached to violations of these regulations and it has to be a penalty commensurate with the violation. In other words, there must be real teeth in this legislation.\n\nIt is not much wonder that government is not interested—and we can see that by the lack of support this motion has received from other members of parliament, notably on the Liberal side of the House—in amending the Privacy Act to include tough penalties for those who would violate the act. I would suggest that most of the time it will be government that is actually in violation of its own act, in violation of its own laws.\n\nI ask members of the House how Canadians can possibly have faith in the Privacy Act and in the work of the privacy commissioner and how they can feel their privacy and their right to privacy is secure and held sacred by the Government of Canada when the laws have absolutely no penalties and no teeth.\n\nI strongly urge the House to make this a votable motion. I ask for unanimous consent that we agree to make this a votable motion and that we send it to the justice committee for a review and ask it to report back to the House as to how that could be done.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, we are now debating Motion No. 19, which I will read to the House. It reads as follows:\n\nThat a legislative committee of this House be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(4)( b ), to remedy the weaknesses of the Privacy Act, including providing relief or compensation for persons who suffer as a result of improper disclosure of their private information and imposing penalties for those who wilfully violate the provisions of the Privacy Act.\n\nWe just finished a lengthy study of the Privacy Act. It started after the last general election and went on for some time. Then, last fall it was put, somewhat hastily, on the government agenda again. Since it was among the commitments made in the throne speech, Canada wanted a privacy act.\n\nI remind the House that we were opposed to this legislation not because of its purpose per se, which was to give Canadians an act that would protect the transmission of personal information, but rather because of the fact that, in most cases, particularly in the case of Quebec where such legislation already exists, several areas were already covered, in fact all areas were already covered.\n\nSome areas are covered by federal legislation and others by provincial legislation. There will be a difficult adjustment for companies whose activities come, for one part, under federal jurisdiction and, for another part, under provincial legislation. But that is nothing new. We see that in so many areas and that will happen now with the protection of private information.\n\nWe have a great deal of difficulty accepting the principle that, because no other province was taking action, Quebec was pushed out of a jurisdiction it was exercising.\n\nThe federal government could very well have recognized in this legislation the precedence of the Quebec consumer protection legislation. Especially since the federal government bragged that its legislation was very similar to the Quebec legislation, with a few adjustments, and that it had borrowed big chunks from it. If both legislation are similar, all the more reason to give precedence to the provincial legislation. Companies, even those under federal jurisdiction, and federal institutions in the province could then be told to abide by the provincial consumer protection legislation.\n\nA whole bunch of overlapping would have been avoided because the current legislation provides for a transition period. For a few years, the act will be only partially in force, but in time its scope will increase and problems will arise along the way. As a matter of fact part of the act is in force now while the rest will be later, in three years.\n\nWe strongly opposed it. My colleague from Mercier initially led the charge on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. Several groups from Quebec came to testify on this bill. I am thinking about—and the intergovernmental affairs minister is going to accuse us once again of bringing out mothballs groups, but I will list a few of those who supported us—the chamber of notaries, the bar, people who cannot necessarily be accused of being part of any political family, let alone the sovereignist family.\n\nThe Conseil du patronat cautioned against it. Quite a few groups, including trade unions, the CSN in particular, submitted briefs. The Quebec access to information commission highlighted all the potential problems and difficulties associated with its implementation.\n\nIn practice, some definitions are different, for example, what is a signature. When we talk about e-commerce, some notions which were defined in the civil code can now be found in the federal act. Their meaning is different because these two approaches—the one based on the civil code and the one based on the Criminal Code or the federal privacy legislation—are very different.\n\nWe are not trying to artificially create a problem where there is none. There are technical problems, and the groups themselves will have to live with that: the lawyers of the Bar, the business people represented by employers and the workers represented by central labour bodies.\n\nOf course, not everyone in this group necessarily has a monopoly on the truth. How did it happen, however, that we found ourselves in the situation—in the case of Quebec—where only the representatives of the Liberal Party were in favour? Perhaps two or three individuals whose motives and often whose links to this government are questionable and who pay lip service to this bill.\n\nThere was therefore very little support for this legislation in Quebec. However, we understand the aim of it: that Canada be governed by a law since there was none outside Quebec. However, I am told some provisions existed in Ontario and perhaps in some other provinces, which were not as extensive as the consumer protection act. It is understandable for Canada to want to be proactive and have a law. That said, if the other provinces do not want to exercise jurisdiction, that is not our problem. And if the federal government thinks that it should exercise it instead, it should have entered into an agreement.\n\nThe ministers of the Government of Quebec have requested meetings and, to my knowledge, they never even received an acknowledgement of receipt or nothing was done to have highly technical and specific discussions to see how to deal with the situation.\n\nNow we have a Reform Party member who, no sooner is the debate over, already wants to amend the act. To my knowledge—and I may be wrong—this legislation was supported by the Reform Party. They could have promoted it more when the bill was being reviewed. There is, among other things, this idea of compensating those who suffer prejudice.\n\nWould this not—I am not an expert on this issue mind you—open the door to compensation whenever there is prejudice? When this happens between parties in a civil case, there are recourses for individuals. Now, must we systematically set out in the act that there will be prejudice and that compensation will be paid to those who suffer prejudice?\n\nAs for the second part of the motion, dealing with applicable penalties, this is already covered. Whether we like it or not, legislation already exists, and there is a penalty for failing to comply with its provisions. In fact, there is whole series of offences.\n\nWhat does this motion mean with regard to penalties? How far are they willing to go? What does it mean in practical terms?\n\nThe motion is relatively precise in that regard. The notion of prejudice is new. It can be understood that it is only a matter of principle. The notion of sanctions or penalties already exists. Why is it not explained more clearly in the motion? It becomes difficult to support a motion the second part of which is vague, and probably deliberately so.\n\nIn any case, it is very difficult for us to support a motion aimed at amending a piece of legislation that is hard for us to live with. The fact that this piece of legislation has been adopted does not mean that the problems I alluded to earlier will not arise with regard to the different definitions in the federal legislation. I used signatures as an example earlier, how an electronic signature is defined, and so on.\n\nOf course, there will eventually be some degree of harmonization, but in the meantime, it may very well be that consumers will not enjoy the same protection as they did before. When only one act applied in Quebec, businesses under federal jurisdiction—and I am thinking specifically about the telecommunications sector—complied with this act. Everybody came under the same legislation and it was known. Now there are two acts.\n\nConsumers will see businesses using the excuse that there is a transitional period, that the federal legislation will be fully in force in a few years, that there are two definitions, that things are complicated, and so on. And there will be consumers who will find it all very confusing and will wonder which of the two pieces of legislation applies, and which protects them and how.\n\nThis is a very complex issue in a sector that is already complex and is evolving very rapidly.\n\nSome of these principles were defended during the committee proceedings, but it might have been better to debate them or to make amendments back then, rather than support the bill, as the Reform Party did when it came time to vote. To my knowledge, we were almost the only ones to oppose the bill. Today, some members are voicing opposition, but they had much less to say when it might have done the most good.\n\nI will conclude by saying that it is very hard for us to support this motion, which is not votable in any event, but had it been votable, it would have been very hard for us to support it.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on Motion No. 19. I thank the hon. member for Skeena for raising the issue and for bringing it before the House.\n\nI believe that it has enough merit to be made votable. I would have liked to have seen that. I am disappointed, as I know he must be, that the committee and members of the House chose not to allow that, which will terminate the debate after only one hour.\n\nI tried to listen carefully to understand the motivation. I think I understand what the member for Skeena had in mind when he put this motion forward. I find the motion vague, but I suppose that is the nature of motions. It gives a general direction; not a specific task, as would be set out in a bill.\n\nI understand that the Privacy Act can be a source of frustration for some in that it does not have the teeth, as the member put it, to really change patterns of behaviour because there is no real discipline involved. There is no real penalty involved for violations.\n\nThe member used the example of a motor vehicle violation. People would not be stopped from speeding if there were no penalty associated with it. We will not get voluntary compliance, and that must be what the Privacy Act is relying on. It is asking people to change their patterns of behaviour, but there is no threat of consequence if they do not choose to do so and do something wrong.\n\nI recognize the whole issue of data services these days. The storage of data is becoming very complex. There are huge personal privacy and public interest issues associated with it.\n\nOne of the worst examples that I can think of, in which the member would be interested, concerns the province of Manitoba. The previous Tory government in the province of Manitoba contracted out the Manitoba health data services to a private firm. It was a local firm, albeit, but everyone's personal medical records were in the hands of a private company.\n\nThat was bad enough. A lot of us did not think that was a good idea. It was on a fee for service basis. That company then further contracted it to Dallas, Texas. So now all of my personal medical records, my mother's records and everybody else's records in Manitoba are stored in Dallas, Texas. We do not know under what circumstances. We do not know if the people there sell membership lists to pharmaceutical companies that may want to mail a letter to a person who has a specific medical condition.\n\nThe fact is that it is no one's business and there should be a tighter grip on very private and very personal medical information. I think it is fundamentally wrong. This is one example of how a person's privacy can be jeopardized by new technology and the way the world is moving in those directions.\n\nI am a little disappointed about the incident that gave rise to the creation of the motion. It was quite narrow in scope. We are really talking about one individual who had a problem with one letter. I am sympathetic. I think it was wrong that the letter became public without the person's knowledge or consent. However, I also feel that if the letter was full of accusations about wrongdoing, people have a right to know who their accusers are. It is a basic tenet of law. It is a basic tenet of natural justice and fairness that we get to know who is making accusations about us.\n\nTherefore, I am not totally stressed by the idea that somewhere along the line the Indian band in question found out who it was that was essentially blowing the whistle on some alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThat leads me to another point I would like to make. This incident may be better addressed through legislation trying to craft whistle blowing protection rather than amending the Privacy Act. What Bruce Starlight was really doing, I suppose, was blowing the whistle on some alleged wrongdoing in the enterprise of which he was a part. He must have been associated with that Indian band.\n\nI ask the hon. member to consider the much broader issue of whistle blowing when he looks into this further. This was not a workplace situation. In this case, it was blowing the whistle on an organization in which the person was a member.\n\nIn a workplace, it could become even more complex. Many recent incidents have surfaced where a worker comes forward, blows the whistle on some alleged wrongdoing in his or her workplace and ends up getting disciplined for it. This is getting to be a very big issue.\n\nWe would like to believe that the public sector is a good employer. I would like to think that it would welcome whistle blowing, that it would want to know if there is something going amiss in its enterprise. Instead, the first swift and immediate reaction is usually to fire the person. The employee does not have any recourse because it is just cause to fire someone for taking any steps that might be to the detriment of the operation.\n\nAnother basic tenet of law is that there is an implied loyalty that is required between an employer and an employee in that situation. An employee is not allowed to do anything that will really damage the reputation of the company or the boss. Therefore, when an employee comes forward and makes public facts that might shut that operation down or cost it money, or essentially blows the whistle on anything that it might be doing, he or she is breaching that implied loyalty of employers and employees.\n\nI would rather have seen the issue of Bruce Starlight addressed in the larger context of whistle blowing legislation of some kind.\n\nWe are looking forward to the day in the not too distant future when that sort of thing is welcomed. I think 35 out of the 50 states in the United States have whistle blowing legislation that is very strong in their public sector. Again, they recognize that a good employer probably wants to know if someone is pilfering money, polluting or any number of things that they might be doing that are not quite copacetic.\n\nI was interested to learn from the member of the Bloc Quebecois that the Privacy Act just underwent a comprehensive review. I would have thought that would have been the time where we could have made amendments to the Privacy Act to try to add teeth, as the member said. I do not know how that opportunity was missed but I did not have any personal dealings with that.\n\nI know most Canadians do want a Privacy Act and most Canadians do worry about what happens with their personal and private information, whether it is their credit card number or, as in the example I gave of the Manitoba health records in the hands of a private firm, and we have lost all ability to edit or control how that material is going to be used or if it will be made public.\n\nFrom what the hon. member for Skeena tells us, there is no penalty if a person does breach the implied trust relationship that exists between my information and the person who is holding my information. I think it is a very legitimate point and makes for an interesting debate. It is frustrating because these debates go nowhere when the item is not deemed votable. It is only an academic exercise we are playing here but to raise the issue on the national stage is a bit of progress we can measure.\n\nWhile I support the concept and I admire the member for bringing the issue forward, I am somewhat frustrated that it is so narrow in scope that it is really only addressing one individual who had a problem with one letter that went public. I am not even sure that it was so wrong for that letter to be made public because somebody who is accused of doing something wrong does have a right to know the accuser. The accuser also has a right to be free of discipline or suffer any negative consequences for bringing these things to people's attention. This brings me again to the point that I wish this issue was dealt with within the context of whistleblowing, not Privacy Act amendments.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion presented by the hon. member for Skeena regarding the Privacy Act.\n\nI do believe that privacy implications in the new age of technology are important considerations. There was a story in the media not too long ago about a woman whose tax information was publicly released because she had filed a complaint. In a subsequent federal court of appeal ruling about her case, the court struck down the disclosure rules that said such personal information could not be released regardless of the case.\n\nThis was a prudent decision by the court and it demonstrated the importance of privacy and protection in this day and age. In the decision there was no compensation provided to the woman whose privacy was inappropriately violated. I believe this is appropriate. It is on this point that I think the hon. member's motion is flawed.\n\nThe member calls for legislation that sets out a compensation provision for those whose privacy is violated. I believe that such an act would lead to large complications in terms of legalities. This could very easily create a paradise environment for lawyers.\n\nTo a greater degree, how does one determine or define injury as a result of a breach of privacy? Does an improper disclosure of one's personal information warrant financial compensation? I do not think in the vast majority of cases where disclosure occurs that the person requires financial reward because of such breach.\n\nI do agree with the hon. member that there are weaknesses in the Privacy Act. For instance, I believe we need to pay greater attention to the implications of personal and corporate privacy in the rapidly advancing information age in which we live. I am not sure that the Privacy Act in its current incarnation can fully address the need for protection in cyberspace and beyond. This is an area on which I believe we must place more emphasis.\n\nI do not think the member's motion is particularly focused on this area. In a world where information is so readily and speedily available, I think it is vital that the Privacy Act be able to respond to breaches of privacy in this area much as it currently does in terms of government not being able to disclose one's tax return and so on.\n\nAs for the second part of the motion concerning punishing those who breach privacy concerns, I think there may be more weight to this section. I doubt that anyone would disagree that it is important to ensure there are proper protections in place to discourage and to punish those who wilfully violate the privacy of another.\n\nI again wonder what sort of approach the member would like to take on this issue. How do we define a punishment when it is next to impossible to define injury in a case like this? I would think that if sufficient damage was done, the individual would have the recourse of a libel suit or another civil pursuit.\n\nAt this level I do not think we necessarily need to bring in legislation as the member has suggested. Instead I believe it would be worth looking at more specific and in depth issues of privacy from the framework of technology and the exchange of information. This is where people need the most protection at this time, where personal information can travel broadly without even the knowledge of the person affected.\n\nOn this point I believe the member has a valid argument that perhaps a parliamentary committee should be struck to thoroughly investigate ways in which we can strengthen the protection that Canadians need in ensuring that their personal information remains just that, personal.\n\nAgain I return to the fundamental flaws in the member's approach to seeking greater privacy protection. It would be quite dangerous to firmly set out penalties and rates of compensation for the acts referred to in the motion. It sets up a legal framework for convicting offenders after the fact whereas what is most needed are preventative measures.\n\nI believe the Privacy Act in its current state addresses most of the issues for which it was intended but I can agree with the motion that perhaps we could tighten it up to ensure there are no gaping loopholes as there were in the tax case referred to earlier. Whereas the most confidential and private of personal information is controlled by the government, there need to be virtually foolproof mechanisms in place to guarantee that John Doe's tax return does not end up in the public domain because he chooses to challenge it. This is a very important responsibility of the government and one that must be maintained and met.\n\nAlthough I agree that some improvements need to be made in the Privacy Act and that it should be a concern and perhaps priority of the House to visit the privacy issues in greater detail, my colleagues and I cannot support Motion No. M-19 because it seeks to create a legal reference point that overlooks the larger issue.\n\nAs members we cannot reasonably determine what price tag to put on somebody's compromise. That is an area that the courts must define. What we can do is strengthen and tighten the framework of privacy protection by responding to the more minute details that are perhaps overlooked at the present time.",

The bill would include relief or compensation for persons who suffer as a result of the improper disclosure of their private information and it would impose penalties for those who wilfully violate the provisions of the Privacy Act. Let me say at the outset that the Minister of Justice does not support this motion.\n\nThere are two laws that affect the protection of personal information held by the federal government. First, section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. This section has been interpreted to deal with privacy.\n\nSecond, the Privacy Act protects personal information collected by the federal government. The Privacy Act was brought into force in 1983 with the agreement of all parties in the House. The act provides individuals with access to their personal information held by the federal government. It further gives individuals some controls over the government's collection and use of this personal information. It also protects the individual's privacy by limiting those who may see this personal information and for what purpose it might be used.\n\nThe Privacy Act sets out the principles of fair information practices thereby requiring the government to collect only the information needed to operate its programs, to collect the information directly from the individual concerned whenever possible, to tell the individual how long it will be used, to keep the information long enough to ensure access by the individual, and to take all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of personal information.\n\nIt should be noted that no federal legislation is in place to protect personal information held by the private sector. In response to concerns raised by Canadians, the government recognized the pressing need for statutory reform regarding the practices of private sector organizations in relation to personal information.\n\nIn October 1998 the Minister of Industry introduced Bill C-54, the personal information protection and electronic documents act, to address these concerns. Bill C-54 was introduced in this session as Bill C-6 and was adopted by the House in October last year. When part I of Bill C-6 comes into force it will apply to organizations in the private sector and will establish their obligations for the protection of personal information. The government is very proud of Bill C-6 and of the value Bill C-6 will add to the privacy laws in Canada.\n\nAs the government continues to scrutinize closely the developments in the area of the privacy law, part of the government's ongoing work is to monitor the practices and trends, both in the public sector and in the private sector, involving the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to consider ways that laws relating to privacy can be improved.\n\nIn his motion the hon. member for Skeena raises a number of interesting points that should be taken into account in the government's ongoing review of the Privacy Act.\n\nWe do, however, have some reservations when it comes to reviewing and amending the present privacy legislation. We feel it would be premature to strike a legislative committee to look at a reform of the Privacy Act.\n\nThis said, the government continues to carefully monitor the current laws relating to the use of personal information. Now that a framework for the protection of personal information is nearing completion with Bill C-6, improvements to federal laws can be considered on a more measured scale. The government will ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are heard, assessed and weighed.\n\nCanadians have demonstrated to us that they value the protection of their personal information and that they appreciate the responsiveness of the government to their concerns. Government will continue to respond to the concerns and needs of all Canadians.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to some of the comments that have been made by members of the House. I appreciate the level of debate that has taken place today.\n\nFirst of all, I believe the member for Winnipeg Centre made the suggestion that maybe it was not wrong and he did not have too much of a problem with the fact that a member of an aboriginal band in Alberta wrote a letter to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and that letter was leaked back to the chief and council.\n\nFor the benefit of the member and for the benefit of other members of the House—and it may not be understood by members—a letter to a minister of the crown written by an individual is considered to be privileged information, the same as any letter received by any one of us from one of our constituents is considered to be privileged information. As members of parliament we do not take that information and share it with the press or with other individual constituents, unless we have expressly received permission to do so by the original author of those letters or those communications. That is considered to be privileged information.\n\nIt is not up to the member for Winnipeg Centre or anybody else to make judgments about whether it was the right thing to do. The fact is, that is the law and the law was violated, and it was violated by members of the minister's department.\n\nIn listening to the debate I heard talk from other members and other parties about Bill C-6 and the government's initiatives with respect to the Privacy Act. I say to hon. members, and the parliamentary secretary in particular, that is all fine and well, but the parliamentary secretary would know that Bill C-6 is designed specifically with the private sector in mind.\n\nBill C-6 does nothing to address the concerns and the rights of individuals with respect to private information that is held by government institutions, and in this case by federal government institutions. There is no institution or organization that holds more personal private information on Canadian citizens than the federal Government of Canada. Therefore, it is the federal Government of Canada that this legislation is targeted toward, or ought to be targeted toward, more than any other organization. That is not to say that the private sector and the initiatives in Bill C-6 are not good initiatives.\n\nI share the concerns that some institutions in the private sector have access to tremendous amounts of private information and I share the view that those private institutions ought to be responsible for the private information they hold and ought to be held accountable in law when they willfully break the privacy rights of Canadian citizens.\n\nI would also respond to the parliamentary secretary, who said that it is difficult to ascertain what damages may be awarded when violations occur. Maybe it was the member from the Progressive Conservative Party who said that. I am not sure. I certainly would not want to attribute comments to the parliamentary secretary if in fact it was somebody else. However, I would say this. There are many instances in law where it is difficult to determine actual damages when there have been wilful violations. I use as an example the laws with respect to defamation, slander and libel. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine what actual financial harm has been done when one individual wilfully defames, slanders or libels another citizen. I do say, though, that as difficult as it might be for the courts to make those determinations, they are granted that purview and do their best to discharge that duty. The mere fact that there are penalties ascribed in law to people who would wilfully slander or libel is a tremendous deterrent and it makes us much more responsible as individuals when it comes to considering how we are going to conduct ourselves. That is why it is imperative that the Privacy Act be amended, that teeth be put into it so that there are real, tough and strict penalties that are attached to violations of those laws so that Canadians can feel much more secure about private information that is held concerning them, in particular private information that is held by the Government of Canada, but by other institutions as well.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, four months ago I stood in the House asking for a commitment to a national child care program and received a half-baked answer about how the government supposedly tried and was stopped by provincial governments.\n\nThe fact is that if the government had the will to do so, it could implement a national child care program right now. Instead, the government has tried to pass the buck of responsibility as it has with many other programs and services.\n\nWhat happened to the 150,000 spaces for children in child care that was promised in 1993? The government promised $720 million for child care in 1993, but it has in fact cut spending. In too many provinces, like my home province of Nova Scotia, the child tax benefit is clawed back when families' main source of income is social assistance, a perverse attempt at addressing poverty which has ensured that the needs of children in poor families have not been addressed.\n\nIf the Prime Minister and the Liberal government really took the needs of children seriously, they would know that the parents of these children have clearly stated that a federally funded national child care program is what both the children of Canada and their parents need to start off on the right path.\n\nLiberal double-talk on child care is just one more example of how the government has been saying one thing and doing another. Over four months ago the government made a speech about how children would be a priority in the 2000 budget. But what has it done over the last six years in power? Broken promise after broken promise has meant simply more poverty and more poor families.\n\nWe all agree on the benefits to children of quality care in and outside their homes in their early years. We all agree that children are a priority. We all know that money exists to make a national child care program a reality. We all know that the only reason we do not have such a program is because of the lack of will and commitment to Canada's children shown by the Liberal government in its race to the bottom.\n\nAs the mother of two children and as a Canadian I think it is unacceptable that only 9% of children in need of care have access to regulated child care.\n\nToday I would ask the government when it will finally agree that we need a federally funded national child care program and when it will commit to a date when it will provide access to quality, affordable child care for all of Canada's children.",

That is simply and purely incorrect. The federal government could not implement such a program because caring for children is part of the responsibility of the provinces.
