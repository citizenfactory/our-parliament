            "text": "moved that Bill C-244, an act to provide for the taking of samples of blood for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing the law and good Samaritans and to amend the criminal code, be read the second time and referred to a committee.\n\nMr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-244, the blood samples act, also known, for reasons I will get into shortly, as the good Samaritan's act.\n\nI will start by telling the ancient story of the good Samaritan. A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among robbers. They stripped him and beat him and went off leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. and likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.\n\nBut a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him. When he saw him, he felt compassion, and came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them, and he put him on his own donkey, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\n\nAnd on the next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper and said “Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you”.\n\nThat is the story of the good Samaritan. It is a story of helping the less fortunate, helping society and doing what is right even if you are the only person prepared to follow through on your own beliefs.\n\nA constituent of mine acted as a good Samaritan but unfortunately paid a price for his actions. He now runs the risk of contracting HIV.\n\nHis father contacted me to tell of the heroic actions of his teenage son. The young man, whom I will call Tim, was working at a retail store when another man grabbed some items and sprinted away on foot. Rather than just shrugging his shoulders and letting him run away, Tim chased after the thief and tackled and held him until the police arrived.\n\nUnfortunately for Tim, the shoplifter cut himself in the action and a good deal of blood was spilt on Tim as he made a citizen's arrest. It turned out that the thief was also an intravenous drug user, well known to the authorities and a high risk of carrying communicable diseases. Some of the virus may have got into Tim's young body.\n\nI am sure Tim did not wait to see whether or not this person had a communicable disease before he did the right thing and stopped him from stealing. I think he is just wired up that way and that he was taught that way. He was brought up in a home where one does the right thing because it is the right thing to do, not because we weigh the risk to our own person.\n\nIt was a tragedy when the police had to break the news to Tim that the thief had refused to give him a blood sample. They told Tim that the law makes it impossible to take a sample unless the person is willing to give it up.\n\nConsequently, Tim was forced into a lengthy, extensive and expensive program of preventive drug therapy just in case the virus was present. The therapy is not 100% effective, of course, but more importantly Tim had to go through this therapy because he did not know one way or the other whether a communicable disease was present.\n\nIf Tim could have known what diseases, if any, the shoplifter had, he could have made a more informed decision about his own health and the care that he should have sought. He could have decided whether to continue to take the medical treatment, because the drug therapy carries with it serious adverse effects. Most of all, Tim would have had greater peace of mind and more emotional strength to face the future if he had known what his chances were of contracting a communicable disease.\n\nUnfortunately, Tim's example is not isolated. Let me read a story of Isobel Anderson, an Ottawa police constable who is in the gallery today. We can read her full story in an article by Anna Nicolle in the November 15, 1999 edition of the Ottawa Citizen . I will read a little of that article:\n\nIsobel Anderson's nightmarish experience began when she arrested a man for armed robbery in October 1997. While searching for weapons, she reached into his pocket and felt a stab of pain. She pulled her hand out to find a bloody needle stuck in her palm. “My first thought, was God, I have AIDS,” recalls Constable Anderson, a mother of three.\n\nShe then went on to describe the emotional trauma she had as a young mother on her own. As she feared, doctors told her the needle may have infected her with HIV. She was advised that if she started treatment with the anti-HIV medication AZT within hours of being jabbed she might not contract the virus.\n\nThen she learned that the robbery suspect refused to take the HIV test and could not be compelled by law to give a blood sample. Hours later the man agreed to be tested because he was hungry. He said “If you give me a hamburger, I will give you a blood sample”. In other words, Ms. Anderson's life, which was hanging in the balance, was only traded off for a blood sample and a hamburger. It should not have to be that way. The law should specifically state that Ms. Anderson had the right to know whether or not that person had a communicable disease.\n\nBoth HIV and hepatitis C can take a long time to develop or incubate. Ms. Anderson continued taking AZT for three days until her initial HIV test results came back negative. Then after consulting with her doctor, she decided not to continue using the drugs. She said that the side effects of her treatment were life changing. The chemotherapy side effects, which involved hives, hair loss and chronic pain, lasted for weeks, to the point where she could not get up out of her own chair.\n\nToday, thankfully, Isobel Anderson is both HIV and hepatitis C negative. It is sad when, under our present legal system, those who help others become helpless, those who sacrifice become sacrificed and the heroes become victims.\n\nThat is why Bill C-244 is for people like Tim and Isobel. It is also for the literally thousands of other Canadians just like them: the paramedics, the police officers, the ambulance workers, the doctors, the nurses, the firefighters, the dentists, the dental hygienists, the security guards and volunteers, the different health workers and attendants, the ski patrol, which was at the news conference this morning, all of the emergency workers and thousands of people like Tim who do a good deed just to help people out. It is for those who give the most to help our society but receive little back in return when they are the ones needing help. That is what this bill is about.\n\nHow would this bill help Tim, Isobel and the thousands of people I mentioned in the future? In a nutshell, Bill C-244 enables a judge to order the taking of a blood sample from any person who is either accidentally or deliberately contaminated a good Samaritan, health care professional, emergency professional or security professional while in the course of duty. The person's blood would be tested for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The blood test analysis would only be shared with the individual from whom the blood sample was taken, the contaminated person, a qualified medical practitioner conducting the test and the police officer responsible for executing the warrant. Only those four people would know the results of those three tests. The blood test analysis would be used for medical treatment only.\n\nWhat would Bill C-244 mean for people like Tim and Isobel? Some people say that it would not mean that much because people might want to take the treatment anyway because relying on the test results of an alleged assailant could provide false assurances.\n\nHowever, I would ask the following question of everyone in the House. What if it were one of the members who had a high risk exposure to someone else's blood or other bodily fluids? What if it were you, Mr. Speaker? Would you not want to know just what it was that you had been exposed to? Would you not want to know what your chances were of contracting a communicable disease? I would say yes, and I am almost certain that everyone else would say yes. Why is this? I think it is because there are three assurances by getting a blood sample from an alleged assailant's blood.\n\nI will talk about the three true assurances that the blood test results would give. First, knowing whether the source person has HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C assures the victim of a better decision regarding his or her own health. The victim has to decide whether to take a very intrusive chemotherapy program to prevent the advance of the disease, and it would help the victim to make that decision wisely because it is a difficult and very traumatic decision to make.\n\nIn Isobel's case and in many other cases, once victims or patients discover that the assailant or injured person has tested negative to these diseases, they terminated the treatment. It gives them a better chance of making a good medical decision in their own lives.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, the Toronto hospital assessed 30 possible sharps-related exposures to HIV. In other words, they were mostly pin pricks from needles where there was possible contamination. Here is one quotation from its study, after counselling of these 30 people, “5 persons chose not to take treatment; 8 persons started chemoprophylaxis but discontinued when the source patient's results were negative”. They changed their minds based on that test result. “Rapid HIV testing helped to reduce the duration of the treatment. The remaining 17 persons planned to take one month of medication; 9 of the 17 completed the medications”, and so on.\n\nThe study stated that the side effects experienced by all persons on these medications included nausea, vomiting, headaches, diarrhea and insomnia. It is a very traumatic chemotherapy prevention program.\n\nThe other serious side effects involve potential harm to reproductive capacity, hair loss, numbness, tingling in the hands or feet, a decrease in the number of white blood cells, anemia, malaise, coughing, abdominal pain, kidney stones and a higher risk of contracting diabetes. All these are side effects from a preventive chemotherapy program.\n\nAs we can see, taking these drugs to fight HIV is not like a doctor saying take two aspirins and see me in the morning. The side effects are serious. Taking these drugs is not entered into lightly. I think everyone would want to know whether or not the person who contaminated them had a serious communicable disease. Clearly it is far better for one's health to stop the treatment than to continue taking the medication if one knows about it. At least that is what many people have decided in these test cases.\n\nThe second true assurance of testing perpetrators' or people's blood is that they are also assured of treatment if carrying a disease unknowingly. Again that would be their decision. Imagine people who perhaps are intravenous drug users and have not bothered to get a blood test. If this situation came upon them, the blood test results would be shared with them. They might want to say that one should know if one has hepatitis B and have some treatment for it, or the side effects or consequences will be serious. It would help such a person as well.\n\nThe third true assurance of testing is that whether negative or positive it provides a greater peace of mind to the good Samaritan, emergency or health professional. Therefore I would argue there are good reasons to take this test and to proceed with it. Testing perpetrators or injured people for communicable diseases will not provide false assurances to the victims and patients. It will provide true assurances and true alternatives for them as they decide what medical treatment they should be taking.\n\nSome people are focused on the negative parts of the bill. They are concerned about charter protection of rights, security of the person and so on. Those are valid concerns that I have tried to address in the bill by making it very difficult but not impossible to get a blood sample from someone who is at high risk of passing on a communicable disease. It is a fair and proper balance between the charter rights of the sick, injured and perpetrators of crime and the charter rights of those who are in service to help others.\n\nUnder the present system emergency and law enforcement professionals and good Samaritans have no right to the security of their person. If these individuals have a high risk exposure to a stranger's blood they have no means to determine the likelihood of whether or not they have contracted a disease.\n\nThey must anxiously await the incubation periods for HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. In the meantime they can choose to undergo medical treatments with severe health side effects, treatments they probably would not take if they knew that the blood to which they had been exposed had tested negative for HIV.\n\nThis situation produces severe mental and physical duress and I believe violates a person's rights. People should have a right to know what virus may have entered their bodies. Bill C-244 would correct this rights imbalance. It does not swing the rights all the way over one way or the other. It tries to find that balance between the rights of a perpetrator of a crime to privacy and security of the person, but it also protects those who are trying to do good in society.\n\nBill C-244 protects people's privacy in four ways. A judge is the only individual who can order that a blood sample be taken. It is not a police officer and it is not a paramedic. The blood samples can only be analysed for hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV. Blood sample results are to be used only for medical treatment purposes and for no other reason. The only people who may have access to the results of the blood test are a peace officer, the medical practitioner, the applicant and the person from whom the sample of blood was taken.\n\nIn summary, the blood samples act is about fairness. Presently people do not have the right to know what may have infected their bodies from a third person, and Bill C-244 would correct this.\n\nSecond, the blood samples act is about balancing rights. Under the present system only the perpetrator of a crime or the injured or sick person has the right to the security of the person. Bill C-244 would correct this negative situation and make it a balance of rights between both parties.\n\nThird, the blood samples act is about helping everyone involved in this very difficult situation. It is about health care, security professionals of all kinds and good Samaritans. It would also assist the crime suspect carrying a serious virus unknowingly. It is about positive change to our legal system that would provide fairness, a better balance between different rights and assistance for those who are in the service of others.\n\nTim, Isobel and thousands of other professionals need this bill, this kind of protection, as they go about their work. In the original story of the good Samaritan the only reward was that his name was enshrined in the Bible and he has gone on to become an example of a good Samaritan. Good Samaritan is still in our language today as an example of people who go out of their way to help others when they could have just passed by.\n\nThe bill recognizes that those who help the needy in society, health care professionals, and what we commonly call good Samaritans should have the assurance of knowing that when they go about their good work, when they do a good deed, when they help the needy, they will not be penalized and restricted by their knowledge. I ask for support from all sides of the House for the bill.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-244, an act to provide for the taking of samples of blood for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing the law and good Samaritans and to amend the criminal code, introduced by the hon. member for Fraser Valley.\n\nThe government and all of us in this place are fully aware that some persons in the execution of their duties, which include helping people and even saving human lives, are at risk of being contaminated by the exchange of infected bodily fluids. This is a very sensitive issue.\n\nWe appreciate the personal difficulties which these persons who devote their lives to help others may experience. We owe it to these fine Canadians to provide them with a means to regain peace of mind as soon as possible after they have been involved in circumstances that may raise the spectre of contamination. However well meaning, and it is very well meaning, Bill C-244 does not represent the solution to this problem.\n\nThe bill is offering to us the creation of legislation that establishes a mechanism for obtaining and executing a search warrant on the human body. Part I of the bill provides that a firefighter, a medical practitioner or a person whose profession is to care for sick people may ask a justice of the peace to issue a warrant authorizing a peace officer to require a qualified medical practitioner or a qualified technician to take samples of blood. These samples would be taken from a person who was assisted by the firefighter or the medical practitioner where there has been contact of body fluid and where the person is suspected of being infected with some disease.\n\nThe bill would also cover the situation of an arrest without a warrant by a person other than a peace officer or when a person lawfully assists a police officer. I note in passing that the bill is not clear as to whether health practitioners can be forced to take the sample and, for that matter, whether and how much force can be used to compel the person to submit to the taking of bodily fluids.\n\nThe examination of these substances would determine according to the proposed scheme whether the person carried the virus of hepatitis B or hepatitis C or a human autoimmune deficiency virus. In order to issue such a warrant the justice of the peace would have to be satisfied by the person requesting the warrant that four essential elements are present.\n\nFirst, the justice has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant came into contact with a bodily substance from another person while engaged in the performance of his or her functions in relation to that person, or while assisting that person believing that his or her life was in danger or that the person had suffered or was about to suffer physical injury.\n\nSecond, the justice may issue a warrant if by reason of the circumstances in which the applicant came into contact with the bodily substance he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant may have been infected by a virus.\n\nThird, the justice could issue a warrant if he or she believes that by reason of a lengthy incubation period for diseases caused by these viruses and the methods available for ascertaining their presence in the human body an analysis of the applicant's blood would not accurately determine in a timely manner whether the applicant had been infected by such a virus that might have been present in the bodily substances with which the applicant came into contact.\n\nFinally a warrant could be issued if a qualified medical practitioner is of the opinion that the taking of samples of blood from the person mentioned in the warrant would not endanger the life and health of the person.\n\nAs we can see the scope of the bill which relates to persons involved in situations where there is an exchange of bodily fluids is remarkably wide. On its face the bill does not apply in cases where an offence is alleged to have been committed but rather in any case where there has been an exchange of bodily fluids.\n\nThe bill assumes that no offence has been committed for the power to seek a search warrant. Thus a warrant to obtain a body sample is sought without any offence being committed. Therefore there is no nexus with criminal law.\n\nWhat criminal law purpose is served by these amendments? Why then are we seeking to amend the criminal code? The search warrants in our law are for the purposes of advancing an investigation of offences. This search warrant is, on the contrary, for the sole purpose of obtaining some information about someone who has not committed any offence. This is an invasion of the privacy of someone, an invasion that is remarkably intrusive, for no reason that would have anything to do with criminal law.\n\nThe bill raises important concerns relating to privacy, searches, seizures and human rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The taking of bodily substances always raises significant constitutional issues. The taking of bodily substances without any charges being laid or before conviction raises issues under section 7 on life, liberty and security of the person as well as under section 8 on reasonable search and seizure of our charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nBeyond the legal impediments in pursuing the legislation there are also clear limitations as to what can be accomplished from a scientific standpoint even if a warrant could be obtained. Thus another reason for not supporting the bill is that even if it were possible to adopt this kind legislation its value as an instrument to comfort those who fear they have been affected is certainly less than adequate.\n\nThe issue of blood samples was studied in depth in relation to criminal law and in the context of sexual assault. The medical experts are of the opinion that the only way a sexual assault victim can be sure that he or she has not been contaminated is to undergo a test to detect the hepatitis B or C virus, or HIV, following the recommended procedures.\n\nThere is a variable period of time between the moment of infection and the capacity of routinely available antibody tests to detect the presence of the antibodies to the virus. Experts in the field refer to that as the window period. Accordingly, relying on the test results could provide false assurances to the victim. For example, a person who would be the object of a search warrant may be tested and the results negative. A peace officer or a firefighter who relies on this information might in fact later test positive if the person tested was in the window period when he or she tested negative.\n\nThe issue of blood testing clearly belongs to the domain of health. The Department of Justice is actively working with other departments, in particular Health Canada, to ensure that more is done to provide support and assistance to those who may be concerned about the risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. This is where our efforts should be concentrated. I encourage these departments to continue these efforts on an expedited basis.\n\nI certainly appreciate that the sponsor of the bill means well. I acknowledge him for his initiative in this regard. The use of search warrants to invade privacy where nothing of a criminal natural is even suspected should be of grave concern to the House when, on top of that, the information that may be obtained with such a search warrant is at best of very limited value. One questions what can be usefully achieved by Bill C-244 notwithstanding its good intentions.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, like the previous speakers I too am pleased to speak to this private member's bill. A private member's bill is an important avenue for those of us in the House to put forward issues we think are important. I commend the member for Fraser Valley for bringing forward this piece of legislation, Bill C-244.\n\nHe began his remarks by talking about and relating the story of the good Samaritan. I suppose it would have been helpful to us all if we had looked back at that time to see if the good Samaritan had taken the gentleman he found in the ditch to be tested for the plague. Then we would not have had to have this debate today. We might have had some guidance from the Divine.\n\nIt is a well intentioned piece of legislation and I commend him for bringing it forward. It raises some important questions about people who partake in the kind of activity envisioned.\n\nWhen listening to his remarks I became a little concerned, and the government member raised some of my concerns. There is a difference between those who engage in criminal activity and the important examples which he has given of those people who in the execution of their professional duties as crime fighters or peacekeepers have suffered or had cause to be concerned about whether they had been infected with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.\n\nA great deal of his time was spent referring to the perpetrators of crime. He is right. When someone is committing an offence, should our police forces or security guards not have a right to find out if they have been infected with some kind of disease if in the execution of their duty, which is the protection of society, they encounter some activity that might cause them concern.\n\nBill C-244 is wider and goes further than that. It does not narrow those affected to those involved in fighting crime and to the perpetrators of crime. The legislation says that a person, not a crime fighter or a police officer, may apply to a justice for a warrant authorizing the taking of a sample of blood from another person who is not necessarily the perpetrator of a crime.\n\nThere are numerous examples. We can envisage how wide ranging the legislation would be. For example, it would apply to firefighters who, in the execution of their duties, perhaps saving an individual from a burning building, come into contact with bodily fluid, blood or whatever, and may have cause to wonder if they have been infected in the line of their duty with some disease. The same would apply to health care workers and paramedics. The bill is quite broad. It applies to persons who in their professional capacity may find themselves in that situation.\n\nLike the government member, I wonder if the criminal code is the best way to meet the need that is obviously a real concern for the member and the people engaged in those activities.\n\nI intend to support the legislation to at least get it to committee where it can be examined. However, I wonder if we might better look at labour legislation, because we are talking about the health and safety of individuals engaged in the performance of their professional duties, be they nurses, firefighters, policemen, security guards, prison guards, teachers or people in day care centres help children. We are talking about a wide range of professionals and working people who are faced in 1999 with health and safety concerns that we could not possibly have imagined 25 years ago.\n\nI applaud the intent of the legislation. The purpose of the legislation is good. However, I wonder if working collectively through the committee, members of the Conservative Party, Reform, the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberals might find a better way to ensure that this legislation does what the member wants it to do without running into all kinds of hurdles. Working collectively we may be able to achieve that.\n\nIn addition to wondering whether the criminal code is the appropriate piece of legislation, there are certain civil liberties that have been raised by the government speaker.\n\nWe may be able to find a way to take the thrust of this legislation out of the criminal code and place it in labour legislation. The government talks about working in tandem with health. I lean toward labour legislation. If we find a way to do that then we may avoid some of the constitutional challenges that could follow as a result of criminal code legislation.\n\nThe hon. member in speaking to his bill referred to the perpetrators of crime. However, I remind him, and he obviously knows, that this legislation has a wider ranging.\n\nI am a lawyer and a bit of a wordsmith, and we deal with words all the time. Subclause 3(b) states that a judge can issue a warrant, and it outlines the considerations. Subclause 3(b) goes on to state “by reason of the circumstances in which the applicant came into contact with the bodily substance”. I need to explore that to see exactly what it means. If it is a matter of a criminal code offence, then we know that if, in the execution of his or her duties—and the examples were given by the mover of the legislation—a police officer gets stabbed by a needle or gets bitten, those are compelling circumstances.\n\nHowever, for a nurse who works in a hospital, in a unit where a number of people suffer from HIV or hepatitis B, are those circumstances sufficiently compelling? No one says, as in some of the criminal cases cited by the member, “I bit you. Now you have HIV” or “I have a score to settle with you and I am going to pierce you with a needle”. How compelling should the circumstances be for the invasion of someone's civil liberties to take a blood sample?\n\nI need some clarification on that. By sending the bill to committee we might very well get some of the clarification that is required.\n\nIn summary, there is a serious point raised by the government, and that is the arresting of someone who has not committed a criminal offence. That is a serious matter for us to consider.\n\nIn this country one of the things we take pride in is our freedom; freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom from arrest without the reading of rights and without knowing what we have done wrong. That is where the criminal aspect of this is different than applying it to the civil aspect, to those engaged in health and safety occupations where no crime has been committed.\n\nI applaud the intent of the legislation. I think it should have serious examination in committee. There are some real concerns that I see with it, but I think that working together we may be able to iron them out.",

It is as if nothing had happened last Friday, as if nothing had gone on in this House, as if there had not been a major attack on a subject of great importance for Canada and for Quebec: democracy. They are carrying on as if nothing had happened.\n\nThis morning we are discussing Bill C-244, a bill that will never get to be voted on, whereas last Friday we learned that the government over there was preparing to use legislation to gag Quebec completely so that it could not decide its political future. I find that rather strange. It is as if nothing had happened; life goes on as before. That is not how things are in real life.\n\nWe are now dealing with Bill C-244 and then we will move on to real business. I will read the title of the bill, and hon. members may understand why I have some hesitations. It is entitled an act to provide for the taking of samples of blood for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing the law—and here is where it gets strange—and good Samaritans and to amend the Criminal Code.\n\nThe last time I personally read the words good Samaritan, it was in the Bible. It is rather odd that we are talking of good Samaritans here this morning, when the government opposite is certainly a good example of what a good Samaritan is not.\n\nThe title is ambiguous, so I thought the contents would be clearer. There are some definitions that I am familiar with because they are the same as those found in the Criminal Code. There is nothing wrong with that. However, let us look at clause 3:\n\nObtaining and executing a warrant\n\n3. A person—\n\nTherefore, I could tell anybody that I want a blood sample taken from them because they came too close to me and I think they have AIDS.",

            "text": "It most certainly is an invasion of privacy. I will now resume reading the clause:\n\n3. A person may apply to a justice for a warrant authorizing the taking of a sample of blood from another person, in order to determine whether that person carries a designated virus, where the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that—\n\nI believe that, yes, he came too close to me. Therefore, by reason the circumstances under which that person came into contact with a bodily substance of the other person, he or she may have been infected by a designated virus.\n\nThis bill goes a little bit too far. We are not used to that in a free and democratic society—or at least I think we are in a democratic society despite the government's attack on Quebec with its referendum legislation. This bill goes too far.\n\nWe are talking about arresting people without a warrant. We are talking about taking a blood sample from a person. What kind of force will be used to obtain that blood sample? Will we have to tie the person up? Will we use the cane the Reform Party wanted to use on young offenders? Exactly what kind of force will be used? It is an extremely complex process. I read the bill about ten times—and I do not think I am stupid—but it would be rather complicated to enforce. In any case, if I am stupid, there are many people on the other side who also are.\n\nSo the process is quite complex, and some of the bill's clauses are extremely difficult to interpret. And, for the first time I am aware of, a person could be required to provide a blood sample even though that person has not been accused of anything and has not committed any offence. This, merely because someone thinks that person may carry the virus and got a little too close to another person.\n\nJust how far are Reformers prepared to go? Do they want to get into people's bedrooms? Whether it is gay or straight people, if someone slept with a person and is upset at that person the next day, will he or she require that spouse or that one night partner to undergo a blood test?\n\nThe Reform Party should clarify its views or intentions, because I sincerely think that this would be a violation of fundamental rights.\n\nOn the face of it, this bill utterly unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois. It is not a votable item, so one can say and propose just about anything in the House—our system is rather archaic, in this regard—and, quite often, what is proposed here is meaningless. This proposed legislation is an example of that.\n\nI began by saying that while we are debating this bill, some extremely important events are taking place, and I want to discuss them. It is unacceptable to be discussing such a measure, when last Friday this government inflicted a terrible blow to democracy in Canada and Quebec.\n\nIt is getting ready to do it again this week with its much-talked-about bill to prevent Quebecers from making a democratic decision about their political future, and this is unacceptable.\n\nIf there is one thing the Liberals have managed to do, it is to unite Quebecers against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The Minister of Justice is nodding in agreement. I think she understands what I am saying, because I think she is a democrat. She must not support the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.\n\nI am certain that, deep down, this wise woman is on the side of justice. I also think that the entire Liberal government opposite should do some thinking and take a look at what all of Quebec's commentators, journalists and politicians wrote on the weekend and today on this subject. They would see that they are alone on this in Quebec and that they are striking a hard blow to democracy.\n\nIn order to give them the time to do a bit of reading and thinking, pursuant to Standing Order 60, I move:\n\nThat the debate be now adjourned.",

            "text": "moved that Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement, be read the third time and passed.\n\nMr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to Bill C-9, legislation giving effect to the Nisga'a final agreement.\n\nWe are nearing the end of a lengthy process, not only the legislative process in the House and the B.C. legislature, but the journey embarked on by the Nisga'a people more than 100 years ago. I am hopeful that when debate in the House concludes, members will see fit to pass Bill C-9 for its consideration in the other place.\n\nI have followed the debate and the committee proceedings with great interest. I thank the members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development for the excellent work they have done.\n\nIt is interesting to note that throughout the debate a number of common themes have emerged from those in favour of the Nisga'a final agreement as well as from those opposed. The agreement meets the tests that have been set out. It will provide certainty. It will remove the restrictions of the Indian Act so the Nisga'a people will have greater opportunities to prosper in the future. It will protect the rights of Nisga'a women. It will ensure that the rights of non-Nisga'a people living within Nisga'a lands have been addressed. It will respect and maintain Canada's existing legal and constitutional framework.\n\nThe Nisga'a final agreement achieves all of these goals and many, many more. It will provide certainty. By clearly setting out all of the Nisga'a aboriginal rights, the agreement gives the Nisga'a and their neighbours a chance to build a future together knowing that issues of the past have been dealt with in an honourable manner.\n\nThe Nisga'a final agreement will settle the ownership of land, not just the land included in the treaty, but the huge expansive territory over which the Nisga'a had originally laid claim. This means certainty for investors which in turn means increased economic activity and employment in British Columbia. Roslyn Kunin, chief economist for the Laurier Institute testified before the standing committee that current uncertainty is costing British Columbians a minimum of $1 billion worth of investment. One billion dollars is the minimum annual cost of not moving ahead.\n\nLet me quote David McLean, chairman of the board of Canadian National, when he addressed the committee. He said: “What appeals to me as a business leader is the certainty it creates”. Of course for the final word on certainty, let me quote the agreement itself: “This agreement constitutes a full and final settlement in respect of the aboriginal rights, including aboriginal title, in Canada of the Nisga'a nation”.\n\nThroughout this debate there has been a great deal of criticism of the Indian Act. Numerous provisions of the Indian Act are not conducive to building successful communities in a modern context. This is especially true as it pertains to land management and economic development.\n\nThe Nisga'a final agreement offers a new approach. For all time it will remove the Nisga'a people out from under the Indian Act. With fee simple ownership of land, the Nisga'a will be able to more fully develop their economy.\n\nThe achievement of self-government means the Nisga'a will no longer have to seek permission of the federal government to conduct their day to day affairs. The Nisga'a people have chosen to take this step forward. They have agreed to a model of government that provides them with greater authority and with it greater responsibility.",

            "text": "They have chosen a path that makes them answerable to themselves and to future generations for the choices they make.\n\nIn short, the Nisga'a people have achieved what most of us take for granted. To reject this agreement would take this achievement away. It would force the Nisga'a to remain under the Indian Act, an act which rather ironically has been most persistently denounced by those speaking against this legislation.\n\nEnding the application of the Indian Act to the Nisga'a also represents a significant gain for Nisga'a women. As I have stated in the House, the Indian Act is silent on the rights of women. Its last major revision was in 1951, long before either the bill of rights or the charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nEnding the Indian reserve system and the Indian Act for the Nisga'a will put Nisga'a women on an equal footing with other women in British Columbia with respect to the division of matrimonial property in cases of marital breakdown. The reason for this is that all provincial laws, including the B.C. Family Relations Act, will apply to Nisga'a lands, something that is not currently case for Indian reserve lands.\n\nOnce again I will quote the agreement: “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to the Nisga'a government in respect of all matters within its authority”. Nisga'a women will enjoy the full equality guaranteed by sections 15, 28 and 35 of the charter.\n\nIn addition, there are important protections for women in our constitution. Section 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982 makes it clear that treaty rights are guaranteed equally to male and female persons. Bill C-9 states in its preamble “The constitution is the supreme law of Canada”. This treaty will operate within the existing Canadian constitutional framework, something which all three parties agree to.\n\nIt is clear that not only does the Nisga'a final agreement protect the rights of women, it offers a significant improvement over the status quo.\n\nThe relationship between the Nisga'a and their neighbours has probably been the subject of more myths and misinformation than any other aspect of the agreement. Throughout the negotiations leading up to the Nisga'a final agreement great efforts were made to accommodate the needs of neighbouring communities and non-Nisga'a individuals who reside on Nisga'a lands. Almost every chapter in the agreement reflects input that was received in nearly 500 consultation and information sessions.\n\nThe agreement does not, as some would have us believe, provide the Nisga'a government with any taxation authority over non-Nisga'a residents. The only taxation authority for the Nisga'a government is found in chapter 16, section 1 of the final agreement, and it only extends to Nisga'a citizens living on Nisga'a lands.\n\nNisga'a lawmaking authority is limited to matters internal to the Nisga'a people, such as their language and their culture. All Nisga'a laws will be subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Nisga'a government will be obliged to consult with non-Nisga'a residents on any proposed measure that substantially affects those individuals who will also, and this is one to remember, have full access to the court system for redress.\n\nWhere institutions are established that affect all residents of the Nass Valley, such as school boards or health boards, non-Nisga'a residents will be able to seek election and vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\nWho better to speak to this issue than the people directly involved? Here is what Bill Young, a businessman, Nass Valley Residents' Association member and the largest non-Nisga'a landowner in the Nass Valley had to say about the Nisga'a final agreement when he testified before the standing committee:\n\nAny fears that we have had are alleviated and clearly defined in the treaty documents.\n\nNisga'a self-government will not have any jurisdiction over land currently owned by non-Nisga'a within the Nass Valley.\n\nI believe that the Nisga'a treaty is a fair and honourable solution that will protect and be fair to all parties.\n\nI ask the honourable members of parliament to ratify this treaty.\n\nTerrace is the city lying closest to the Nisga'a. Here is what the mayor, Jack Talstra, had to say to the committee:\n\nWe wish the treaty signed sooner, rather than later, so we might focus our energy and creativity on implementation, rather than past discussion and previous arguments.\n\nLet us move forward with this new treaty.\n\nAs hon. members can see, this government is listening to the people most directly affected by the Nisga'a final agreement. Those people are comfortable with the agreement. They have received the assurances and protection they sought. They recognize the benefits that everyone will derive from the treaty. They want us to get on with the job.\n\nFinally, I would like to touch on the relationship between the Nisga'a final agreement and the Canadian legal and constitutional framework. There are those who continue to state that the agreement changes the constitution. As I have before, I would refer them to the agreement itself, which states quite clearly “This agreement does not alter the constitution of Canada”.\n\nThe committee held a great deal of testimony from constitutional and legal scholars and experts. There was a general consensus that the agreement does not change the constitution, and the self-government provisions of the agreement serve to define an already existing constitutional right.\n\nAs Professor Patrick Monahan of Osgoode Hall Law School stated:\n\nWe are not creating a third order of government because on this argument the courts have implicitly already recognized that aboriginal peoples and rights of self-government of aboriginal peoples have constitutional status.\n\nClarifying the Nisga'a right to self-government sends a positive signal. It demonstrates that this government is serious about the relationship we are trying to build with aboriginal people and it shows what we can accomplish within the existing framework.\n\nI have just quoted the agreement to the extent that it does not alter the constitution. It is also quite clear that the treaty will be subject to the constitution and the charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nDespite the often unfortunate history of our relationship with the Nisga'a people, I have heard Nisga'a tribal council president Joe Gosnell speak about his pride in Canada and in being a Canadian. The Nisga'a people never wanted an agreement that would make them less Canadian. By framing the final agreement within the Canadian constitution they have demonstrated in a tangible way their desire to remain an active part of the Canadian family.\n\nNot only is the agreement clear on the application of the constitution and the charter, it is clear on the application of federal and provincial laws. The self-government provisions of the agreement do not provide the Nisga'a government with any exclusive lawmaking jurisdiction. The Nisga'a government's authorities are clearly defined and the Nisga'a government will only have authority over the matter specifically outlined in the agreement.\n\nThe Nisga'a government will have the principal authority to make laws, and I quote the agreement again, “in respect of Nisga'a government, Nisga'a citizenship, Nisga'a culture, Nisga'a language, Nisga'a lands and Nisga'a assets”.\n\nWhen I appeared before the standing committee I challenged members opposed to the agreement to demonstrate why the Nisga'a should not have primary authority over their language and culture. So far I have heard no response to that challenge. I also challenged those members to demonstrate why the Nisga'a should not have authority over land use planning that is consistent with the authority enjoyed by neighbouring municipalities. Once again I have heard no response.\n\nIn some other areas the Nisga'a may adopt their own laws, but those laws will only take precedence if they meet or exceed standards in federal or provincial law. For example, if the Nisga'a decide that they want to include the teaching of Nisga'a language or culture in their schools they may do so. Teacher certification and curriculum standards must meet or exceed provincial standards. This only makes sense.\n\nIn the great majority of lawmaking areas either federal and provincial laws will prevail or the Nisga'a will have no authority to make laws. The interests of the Nisga'a and all other Canadians are met with these arrangements. The Nisga'a did not ask for unreasonable authorities and we would not have agreed if they had.\n\nAs we enter a new millennium it is imperative for Canada to renew and define its relationship with aboriginal people. Every day we can see the results of the status quo. How we define that relationship will vary from community to community and from province to province. First nations have different circumstances, different needs, and different desires. The arrangements we make with them have to reflect that.\n\nLet me be clear, this government's policy is that the relationship will be developed. We have a fundamental difference of opinion with those, like members of the Reform Party, who do not see the need to develop that relationship; those whose view of equality is to offer people individual cash payments if they agree to give up their constitutional rights; those who deny the balance between individual and collective rights that has made Canada such a unique and successful country; those who see society as a competition where the strongest thrive and the weakest are left to fend for themselves; and those who would perpetuate the mistakes of the past by imposing their belief system on cultures that thrived for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. That approach would never lead to the new relationship to which this government is committed. The Nisga'a final agreement proves that we can develop that relationship. It proves that first nations, provincial governments and the Government of Canada can reach honourable arrangements that satisfy the needs of all parties.\n\nIt is a promising first step. The adoption of the Nisga'a final agreement will send a clear signal that we as a society are ready to build new relationships based on mutual trust, respect and understanding. The adoption of Bill C-9 and the Nisga'a final agreement will bring one journey to an end, but it will also mark the beginning of another journey, one in which Canada and the Nisga'a enter the millennium together, united as we have never been before in our efforts to build a better society for future generations.\n\nIt has been an honour to have the opportunity to speak to a treaty that will go down in history as defining a new relationship with aboriginal peoples based on trust. I think that speaks much to Canada's viability in the future.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the process which led to this agreement.\n\nIn 1991 the federal government, the province of British Columbia and the Nisga'a leadership signed an agreement to negotiate a land claim settlement behind closed doors, out of the public eye. I was not even aware that this agreement had been signed. Most British Columbians were not aware that the Government of British Columbia and the federal government were intent on doing this.\n\nI was elected as member of parliament for Skeena, which encompasses the Nisga'a traditional lands, as it does the Gitksan, the Gitanyow, the Tahltan, the Tsimpsean, the Haisla, the Haida and the Taku River Tlingit. I became aware in 1994 that this agreement had been signed and that there were negotiations taking place behind closed doors. I became rather concerned, because any time government wants to negotiate agreements behind closed doors which have the potential to impact the area that I represent, I feel that I have a duty, an obligation and a right to know what is being discussed. I believe the people in the area that I represent have the same right. They have the right to know what is going on.\n\nI wrote to the minister of the day asking to be included in some form in order to keep abreast and be aware of what was being discussed behind closed doors so I could report back to my constituents.\n\nI received a very curt response telling me that there was a secrecy agreement that the parties were bound to, and that I was not privy to the information, as an elected representative of Skeena encompassing the Nisga'a traditional lands, nor was I about to be given any information with respect to the negotiations.\n\nI felt it was my duty at that point to inform my constituents of what was going on. We held a series of townhall meetings throughout Skeena and then throughout British Columbia during the course of 1994 and 1995 trying to make British Columbians aware of the precedent setting set of negotiations taking place. We recognize, as do most thinking people, that this was a precedent setting set of negotiations. It was the first land claim treaty to be negotiated in British Columbia in modern times. It obviously will set the floor and not the ceiling for other land claim agreements in British Columbia, and across Canada for that matter.\n\nThe minister and the Government of British Columbia try to tell us that this is not a template, although Premier Clark, in his more lucid moments, did admit that it was indeed a template.\n\nI ask anybody watching the debate on television how anybody could possibly believe that a native negotiator somewhere in British Columbia negotiating a treaty would not look at what the Nisga'a have received and say that they have at least an extremely strong morale argument, if not a legal argument, to say “we are entitled to the same thing”. How can the Government of Canada deny that?\n\nI and many of my colleagues in the Reform Party from British Columbia attempted, to the best of our abilities, to shed some light on what was taking place. The government steadfastly refused to provide any information, not only to me but to any members of the public.\n\nIn 1996, with a great deal of fanfare, the government released jointly with the Nisga'a leadership what is known as the AIP or agreement in principle. From that, we started to get a much clearer picture of what was intended in terms of a final agreement because the framework for the final agreement was before us.\n\nIt was at that point that the provincial government put together a parliamentary committee, the committee for aboriginal affairs for British Columbia, and went around the province in what I call a dog and pony show, ostensibly to hear the views of concerned citizens in British Columbia and to take into account what the concerns or views might be in relation to the AIP so that the final agreement could reflect those.\n\nI attended some of those hearings held by the committee. I can tell the House what happened. There was a long list of people who were put in place by the government, who were set up ahead of time, and who showed up and lauded the treaty's benefits and all of its supposedly wonderful clauses and so on. Anybody who showed up and expressed concern or opposition to any of the elements of the agreement in principle were routinely dismissed and often dismissed with the most degrading kind of attacks on their character and their motives because they disagreed with the direction in which the government policy was going.\n\nIt is shameful that British Columbians and Canadians cannot go to a meeting and express their views and opposition to the principles incorporated in the AIP without being treated in that manner. That is the way the government and the Government of British Columbia treated citizens not only in my constituency but right across the province. I was there for it. It is a matter of record because it is in the British Columbia proceedings. All the meetings that committee held were recorded and it is a matter of public record. I invite anybody who has any questions whatsoever to access it through the Internet because it is all there.\n\nIn August 1998, the federal government, the provincial government and the Nisga'a leadership unveiled the final agreement. We were very anxious to see it. We looked through it and noted right away that as a result of the committee's work in British Columbia and all the public concern, criticism and so on of various components of the Nisga'a treaty, not one major change was made from the AIP to the final agreement. It was essentially the same. It was just the framework fleshed out with the same principles, the same policy, the same direction.\n\nThe rank and file Nisga'a people, who this agreement will affect the most, were given a few weeks to consider this agreement before they had to vote on it in the ratification process. They were given a few weeks to consider a final agreement that is 250-some pages long and 450 pages of appendices. They were supposed to evaluate a new Nisga'a constitution, a taxation agreement and other related documents. They were supposed to review all of this and make a decision within a few weeks as to whether or not this was the right thing for them and their families to go.",

            "text": "Many Nisga'a people have told us that the ratification process was not fair. This charge was made by people such as Frank Barton. He made these charges when he came before the federal standing committee when it was in British Columbia and there has been no response from any of the parties involved.\n\nThe minister talked about what he and the government characterize as the myths in the treaty. The minister stood in the House of Commons and, with a straight face, said that when the federal committee held hearings several weeks ago in British Columbia and Ottawa, there was “general consensus” that the Constitution of Canada would not be altered as a result of this agreement.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. The minister knows that and he sits there with a smirk on his face because he thinks it is funny when the likes of Professor Stephen Scott from McGill University, a recognized legal expert; Professor Tom Flanagan from the University of Alberta; Mel Smith, former constitutional adviser to the Government of British Columbia for several decades; Gordon Gibson, the former leader of the Liberal Party of British Columbia; Professor Ehor Boyanowsky from Simon Fraser University; and Liberal leader Gordon Campbell of the current Liberal opposition in British Columbia, all appeared before that committee and said exactly the opposite.\n\nHow can government members and this minister sit there with smirks on their faces and say that there is general consensus that this agreement does not change the Constitution of Canada? That is a load of bunk and the minister knows it.\n\nHow does it change the constitution? There are at least 14 areas in the agreement where the Nisga'a central government will receive legislative authority that goes beyond the reach of parliament and beyond the legislature of British Columbia and that will be constitutionally protected under section 35 of the Canadian constitution. It will be considered an aboriginal or treaty right. It is right in the Nisga'a treaty itself that this treaty exhaustively sets out section 35 rights. Chapter 11 in this agreement, which deals with self-government, will obviously be considered an aboriginal treaty right and it will be constitutionally protected. It will be entrenched in constitutional concrete, never to be changed.\n\nWhen I look around the House at the opposition parties that have a solemn duty to uphold the Constitution of Canada and I see what they have done in collusion with one another to override the constitution and to go against the wishes of Canadians, because Canadians said no to this very idea in 1992 in the Charlottetown accord, I am appalled. I am sickened by what members of the House have done or are attempting to do. That is not a myth. Those are the plain facts.\n\nIf the government wants to entrench aboriginal self-government as a constitutionally protected right with legislative authority that goes beyond the reach of parliament and the provincial legislatures, it can do it but it has to use the amending formula. It needs seven provinces with 50% of the population to do it. It tried to do that in 1992 with the Charlottetown accord, the same political parties that are here now with the same faces and the same failed ideas, and the Canadian people and British Columbians said “no'. British Columbians had the highest no of all the provinces. Aboriginal Canadians also said no.\n\nWhat part of no does the government and the other political parties not understand. Why are they colluding with one another to try and get this constitutional amendment through the back door? Frankly, I find that sickening.\n\nIn 1950, the Supreme Court of Canada said, in the Lord Elgin Hotel case, if the minister cares to refer to it, “The Constitution of Canada does not belong to the legislatures. It does not belong to the politicians. It does not belong to governments. It belongs to the people of Canada and the people of Canada are the only ones who can consent to these kinds of constitutional changes”. There is an amending formula to determine whether that consent is given or not.\n\nBut no, the government and other parties are trying to do an end run around that. They are trying to do an end run around the amending formula and around the constitutional process to entrench aboriginal self-government as a constitutionally protected right with legislative authority that for all time will go beyond the reach of parliament and the reach of the provincial legislatures. That is exactly what René Lévesque was talking about when he spoke about sovereignty association. What this will do is create a semi-sovereign state within the boundaries of Canada.\n\nAs a precedent, because the government is pressing ahead with other treaties, not just in British Columbia but in other parts of Canada, what Canadians can expect over time is a large number of semi-sovereign states within the boundaries of Canada where people will live by different rules, different regulations and a different status based on ethnicity. Frankly, I find that idea repugnant.\n\nThe idea of legislated segregation has been tried around the world. The minister, instead of sitting there flapping his gums, should get out his history books and read what happened in the United States and in South with legislated segregation. The government can say that this is legislated segregation driven with good intentions. I do not doubt that it is, but legislated segregation driven with good intentions is not acceptable. It is always wrong. That is what the government and the other political parties in the House are in agreement on.\n\nIn the history of Canada, from before Canada was a country and before Confederation, in dealing with aboriginal people, there is a history of legislated segregation. Look where it has left native people in the country. We do not have to go any further than the closest reserve. Most reserves are not very desirable places to live. Unemployment is at 70%, 80% or 90%, depending on which reserve we are talking about. There are social pathologies that are unheard of in other Canadian communities. There are people living in squalor, in what amounts to third world conditions, as we have heard so many times in the House.\n\nWhy does the government not get the message? Legislated segregation does not work. The people it affects the most are the people this kind of policy is supposed to help. If I were an aboriginal Canadian I would ask the federal government to stop helping me because all the help it has given so far has not been very good. I would ask the government to leave me alone, but it will not.\n\nThe Liberals talk about the application of the charter of rights and protecting the rights of Nisga'a women and other aboriginal women in Canada. The minister sits in the House and pontificates. I do not know why he has not bothered to listen to people like Mizie Baker, a Squamish woman who came before our committee because she was not allowed to appear before the minister's committee to testify, or Wendy Lundberg who came before our committee because she was denied the opportunity to go before the minister's committee. He did not want to hear from her. The Liberals did not want to hear from these people. They do not like to hear from anyone who disagrees with them.\n\nIt is not unlike some of the more dictatorial regimes we have seen around the world in recent history. They insulate themselves from any kind of opposition or negative feedback from Canadians. People such as Mizie Baker and Wendy Lundberg, as well as a number of other aboriginal women, have told us of their concern and their lack of rights as aboriginal women, as Canadians, not only through this legislation but also through Bill C-49.\n\nWendy Lundberg wrote a letter to a Liberal member from British Columbia expressing her concern over the fact that her rights as an aboriginal woman were not protected. The response she received from the Liberal member of parliament was that they were working on that. Her letter was written in relation to Bill C-49 and in relation to the Nisga'a final agreement.\n\nHow will the charter of rights and freedoms apply? There is wording in chapter 2 of the agreement, the general provisions, which says that the charter of rights and freedoms applies, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of the Nisga'a government. What do they mean? They sound like innocuous words.\n\nWe are not constitutional or legal experts so we took the time to consult with the likes of Professor Tom Flanagan, Professor Steven Scott, Mel Smith and others. We took the time to ask them what it meant in their view. In their view the addition really means that the Nisga'a central government will have a free rein in denying charter rights, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of the Nisga'a central government.\n\nI do not mean to imply the Nisga'a leadership that negotiated this agreement has ulterior motives. I do not know and I am not trying to make that allegation, but this sets the groundwork for individual charter rights to be overridden in the future.\n\nUnder section 35 of the constitution the Nisga'a final agreement will be considered an aboriginal or treaty right. Under section 25 of the constitution in applying the charter of rights and freedoms, aboriginal and treaty rights take precedence over individual rights as expressed in the charter. That is not a myth. Any Canadian can read the charter of rights and freedoms and section 25 of the Canadian constitution. I do not think the minister has read it but I urge him to do so. From the way he talks in the House, I do not think he has read the agreement or is familiar with it.\n\nThere is no question that the individual rights of Nisga'a people are seriously diminished as a result of this agreement. There is no doubt about that whatsoever.\n\nNot only Nisga'a people but more and more aboriginal people in British Columbia are coming to understand that. They are concerned about it. They are asking how they can deal with a government that will come along in the future, for example, and ban trade unions like the Kamloops band recently attempted to do in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happens if a future Nisga'a central government or some other aboriginal government that is working within the same kind of self-government framework as in this document happens to say that trade unions are culturally incompatible with Nisga'a tradition? They have legislative supremacy in the area of culture. In the self-government provisions they have the absolute right to regulate and ban businesses, professions and trades on Nisga'a land. That is not a myth. It is right in the agreement.\n\nIf a Nisga'a central government takes that position, what would be the recourse of the people who have attempted to organize the trade unions? They could go to court if they have the money but likely they will not have it to do that. However, if they go to court and say that their charter rights have been violated as a result of the law that has been passed by the Nisga'a central government, the Supreme Court of Canada will have to look at the section 35 rights.\n\nThe court will have to apply those rights as they relate to section 25 of the constitution. It will have to look at the wording bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of the Nisga'a government. It will have to look at the provisions that say that the Nisga'a central government has the absolute right to regulate and ban businesses, professions and trades on Nisga'a lands. With all those taken together it is easy to see that the court will have a difficult time upholding the charter of rights of Nisga'a individuals under those circumstances. That is just one set of circumstances.\n\nThe Nisga'a will have legislative authority to determine Nisga'a citizenship. That legislative authority goes beyond parliament and provincial legislatures. In other words it is up to the Nisga'a central government to determine who is a citizen and who is not.\n\nWhat happens if one is a Nisga'a living in the Nass Valley in one of the four Nisga'a communities who happens to disagree vociferously with the Nisga'a central government on an issue or on a range of issues? One becomes what is known as a dissident. This has happened in other aboriginal communities in Canada. We have had letters from people on reserves in the prairies and so on where leadership has determined that in some cases the easiest way to deal with dissidents was to excommunicate them or attempt to pull their band membership.\n\nRight now under the Indian Act and under the current system, which I do not mean in any way to defend, at the very least there is the ultimate protection of the Parliament of Canada for those people if the Parliament of Canada chooses to invoke it. However, under the Nisga'a final agreement that is lost forever.\n\nIf in the future the Nisga'a central government determines that people are not citizens for whatever reason, they are no longer entitled to be considered Nisga'a or to receive or partake in the benefits of this treaty. In fact they become exiles in their own lands. Aboriginal people in British Columbia have told me of their concerns about being exiles in their own lands. That is an absolute fact.\n\nIn terms of principle, individual rights versus collective rights is at the core of this treaty. Fundamentally that is what is the most wrong with it. The province of British Columbia and the Government of Canada, but primarily the Government of Canada, see aboriginal people as collectives. They do not see them as individuals.\n\nThey do not realize or choose not to realize that the 400,000-odd aboriginal Canadians who live on reserves in Canada today are all individuals. They do not think the same way. They do not want the same things. They are like everyone else. They have many different aspirations, hopes, dreams and goals.\n\nHow will they be able to reach those aspirations, dreams and goals when collectivities with centralized decision making will have enormous control over assets, land and wealth? Very little of it will flow to individuals. Most of it will flow to collective ownership. How will these people tap into that as individuals and get ahead?\n\nI talked about legislative segregation a few minutes ago. Collectivities have been tried all over the world. In east bloc countries it was known as communism or state socialism. It has been a demonstrated failure everywhere it has been tried.\n\nWhat makes these people so arrogant as to believe that they somehow have a new formula for recreating a failed idea and making it work? Who will suffer the most? It will be the very people that the agreement ostensibly sets out to help.\n\nWhy cannot the government think outside the box? Why can it not stop for a few minutes? Why cannot the minister and the department stop and re-evaluate where they are going with aboriginal policy, where they have gone, where they would like to go, and do it in a manner that is intellectually honest? With this agreement and with the policy coming from the government we have seen a tremendous amount of intellectual dishonesty.\n\nWe have seen a government that routinely tries to downplay and conceal the extent of accountability problems on reserves, which exist because the government has set forth policies that allow them to happen and create the environment for them to happen.\n\nWhy cannot the Government of Canada just once look at aboriginal people as individuals, not as collectives? Why cannot the government resolve these claims which we all agree need to be resolved with a generosity of spirit, a fairness of mind, and bearing in mind the horrible position in which aboriginal people have been placed as a result of legislated segregation in the country? The real crime perpetrated against aboriginals in Canada is legislated segregation.\n\nWhy cannot the government look at individuals and come up with a policy that says in resolving these outstanding claims and in trying to set things right it will try to the greatest extent possible to compensate individuals with land, cash and other assets? At the end of the process aboriginal people who freely choose of their own accord to stay together in communities will be provided with a municipal style government not unlike that of the city of Toronto, the city of Brantford or the city of Kamloops, British Columbia. What is wrong with that?\n\nWhy does the federal government and the province of British Columbia insist on having a form of government which can only be called a semi-sovereign state with legislative authority that goes far beyond that of any municipality in the country? Why cannot they see aboriginal people as individuals? Why cannot they go in that direction?\n\nI do not think most Canadians would object in any way to a true municipal style of aboriginal self-government for aboriginal people. It would give aboriginal people who choose to stay in aboriginal communities the tools they need to run their communities as much as it gives the people who freely choose to live in the city of Ottawa as a group of citizens the tools they need to have a city that functions, that provides transportation corridors and transportation services, snow removal, and all other things we expect from a city.\n\nAt the same time it would also provide them with the absolute protection of the Canadian constitution, most particularly the charter of rights and freedoms. It would also break from the notion of centralizing collective ownership and decision making in the hands of a few people.\n\nI am puzzled, frustrated and completely unable to understand why the Government of Canada cannot see that. Why can it not pause and go through an intellectual debate that is honest and willing to look at history, even recent history, and look at the failure in that recent history and learn from it rather than repeat it over and over again? I am appalled that the Government of Canada wants to continue to march down this road; damn the torpedoes, not a care about what British Columbians think or what other aboriginal people think.\n\nThe rudest comments are made about those who disagree with it. Their character and motives are trashed. They are called bigots, anti-Indian, racists. I could go on and on. That is what the other parties in the House either imply or sometimes directly say when they talk about anybody who expresses opposition to the principles contained in the agreement.",

However, I would like to point out that the member from Kamloops, who is not here right now, not a week ago in public, in a widely circulated media interview, said exactly that. I would ask the hon. member in all fairness to look up what the hon. member from Kamloops said. I am not making it up.\n\nAnd it was not just once. It has been over and over again. Members on this side of the House have said this about Reformers in the House. That is a matter of public record. I am sorry if it offends people, but it is the truth. That is what happened and it happened with the member from Kamloops not 10 days ago in an interview. They should be ashamed of themselves. We should be able to engage in honest, intellectual debate without getting into that kind of mudslinging and name calling.\n\nI will conclude my remarks by saying that at the end of the day in discussing this treaty the people we ought to be considering the very most is the Nisga'a people themselves. They are going to have to live with this for all time because it will be set in constitutional concrete.\n\nI say that individual Nisga'a people, and I think there are more of them who are coming to understand it, are going to recognize that this is not a good deal for them. It is not a good deal for their families.\n\nIt is going to be a good deal for people who are involved in Nisga'a central government for sure. It is going to be a good deal for lawyers as my colleague points out. It is going to be a good deal for all those hangers on in the Indian industry in this country who have been sucking millions upon millions of dollars out of the taxpayers' wallets and out of the aboriginal communities for decades now. It will be a good deal for them.\n\nIt will be a good deal for the courts. The Marshall decision was based on a treaty that was half a dozen pages in length. Imagine the amount of litigation that will come out of this kind of an agreement.\n\nThe minister even said in his remarks a few minutes ago in the House that people have access to the courts. What kind of answer is that for a minister of the crown to be giving? It is almost as if the Liberals are inviting and expecting legal challenges. They want to see it happen. Maybe all their friends in the legal profession are rubbing their hands together waiting for this to get passed so they can all make a buck on it.\n\nThis will not be a good deal for Nisga'a people. That will become evident very quickly. It will not be a good deal for other aboriginal people in Canada because the precedent has been set in terms of the government's provisions in this treaty, in terms of collective ownership of land and collective control over finances. At the end of the day it is supposed to be the Nisga'a people who benefit from this.\n\nLet the record show that the Reform Party was the only party that stood in the House and said that not only is this deal unprincipled, not only is it unconstitutional, but it is wrong for the country and for all Canadians. Let it be said and never forgotten that the Reform Party was the only party that stood in this parliament and said that this agreement is bad for Nisga'a people. History will prove us right.\n\nWe know the Liberals have the majority. We know that they can ram this through. That is the way our dysfunctional parliamentary system is operating in Canada these days. We know that the Liberals can get away with it. We have mounted the best opposition that we could. We have done everything within the powers that are granted the official opposition to highlight the defects in this deal and to bring it to the attention of Canadians.\n\nLet the history books show that we did our jobs while other members of this place sat in their seats. They would not hold the government accountable. They were in collusion. They were intellectually dishonest. At the end of the day they failed not only to serve Canadians, but they failed to serve the best interests of the Nisga'a people.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I usually begin my speeches on Indian affairs by saying that I am very pleased to address the issue, but today it is with somewhat mixed feelings that I do so.\n\nI am pleased because this is a historic day—and I know that a number of Nisga'a are in the gallery today—a day when we will finally vote to give the Nisga'a the opportunity to shake off a yoke called the Indian Act. The Nisga'a have been constrained by that act for over 100 years, and today the Bloc Quebecois, along with other parties in this House, will enable the Nisga'a to free themselves from that act.\n\nI have mixed feelings however because, while we are about to do this for the Nisga'a, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wants to put Quebecers under a yoke. This threat is the reason why it is somewhat difficult for me to be totally pleased on what should otherwise be a happy occasion.\n\nThe Nisga'a will understand that if the Bloc Quebecois supported their quest for self-government, it must also protect the Quebec people, another very important people in Canada but who many in this House will not recognize. I will elaborate toward the end of my speech.\n\nI first want to salute Joe Gosnell and Harry Nice, who co-ordinated the entire negotiation team which is here today. I know this is a very important day for them, bringing to a close a long negotiation process.\n\nEarlier I listened to the hon. member for Skeena, who said that negotiations first began in 1981, but in fact we must go back much further than that. We must go back to the end of the 19th century.\n\nEven then aboriginal leaders were trying to convince the British crown in London of the importance of greater autonomy. This dragged on for over 100 years. I agree with the member that the pace has picked up in the past 20 or 25 years. Now we are reaching a conclusion with the signature of a final agreement and the necessary endorsement of the Parliament of Canada.\n\nI first heard about the Nisga'a people at the time the agreement in principle was signed. I went to their territory and was shown around. These people were very happy about the signing of the agreement in principle, but I do not think they had any idea that, even after signing an agreement with the federal government, a whole series of stumbling blocks would remain before the final stage of third reading in the House of Commons, not to mention Royal Assent in the Senate. Today, they have made it through all these hurdles and the Bloc Quebecois has been with them all the way.\n\nWhen parliament signed the final agreement last spring—the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development signed it—I again visited the Nisga'a territories and received the same welcome. It is an amazing area, with the Nass River that I mentioned earlier.\n\nThis far north in British Columbia, the water is the most amazing shade of blue-green. This is the result of mineral salts in the water. The Nisga'a attachment to the land of their birth, to the Nass River and the entire river valley, which is of extreme importance to them, is understandable.\n\nEvery time I have been there, I have had a chance to see what they call the lava beds. There is a fable relating to these waterways. I have read this fable; nearly 2,000 Nisga'a died 500 years ago because of a volcanic eruption.\n\nAccording to the fable, the children had lost contact with nature and were mistreating animals. They were extremely cruel to the animals. The elders apparently told them “Stop your cruelty or the Creator will get angry if we are too cruel to the animals.” According to the fable, the volcano then erupted and two whole villages were engulfed by the lava, killing close to 2,000 Nisga'a villagers, who now lie under the lava beds of the volcano.\n\nIt was all explained to me during my visit. I was told about the importance of fishing, especially salmon fishing using the famous salmon wheel. When the salmon swim upstream, they swim into a sort of paddlewheel, which scoops them into a box where they can be kept fresh for days until they are caught. I thought this was an invention of the native people of the Yukon, but the Nisga'a have assured me that they are the ones who invented it. This goes to show how important fishing and this wheel is to the Nisga'a.\n\nMy guide on my latest visit was Eric Grandison, and with the usual warm welcome one gets from the Nisga'a, he took me to his mother's home to see the family smokehouse, where we sampled some excellent smoked salmon. This was not frozen smoked salmon like Price Club salmon. This was salmon that had been caught only a day or two before and then fully smoked. The taste was exquisite and this was something that one can rarely, if ever, get here.\n\nUnfortunately, I would have had the opportunity to taste it again here last week but the Bloc Quebecois Christmas party was the same night as their salmon party so I could not attend.\n\nDuring my two visits there, I could see that a rush on the natural resources on the Nisga'a lands was under way. The first time, when I visited the lands of the Chilcotin and Carrier Sekani, hundreds of trucks were hurrying to cut down the forests as quickly as possible before the land was handed over to the aboriginal people.\n\nThe Nisga'a will now have control over their own forests, but I also want to speak up for the Carrier Sekani and the Chilcotin, whose land claims are ongoing and who are unfortunately the victims of this rush on natural resources.\n\nThe agreement in principle and the historic bill were presented. After second reading, we travelled to British Columbia. We went to Terrace, Prince George, Smithers, Victoria and Vancouver. I will admit that it was a bit of a shock to Bloc Quebecois members. The hon. member for Manicouagan was also with me.\n\nOf course, we asked for interpretation services. The witnesses who spoke in support of aboriginals and aboriginal people themselves were treated shoddily at the hearings. Bloc Quebecois members were stunned whenever they were asked to “speak white”. This was very shameful.\n\nI do not want to make any generalization, but I think those who said that are best described as “rednecks”. My feeling is that these people came out to treat the Nisga'a, the aboriginals and French speaking people in a malevolent way. However, after speaking with many people in Terrace, Victoria and Vancouver, I am convinced that these rednecks were a very small minority.\n\nI raised these incidents with Phil Fontaine, the first nations chief, when he made his presentation on the Nisga'a. His response was “You were told to “speak white” during one or two days, while this is the attitude we have been confronted with all our lives. How do you feel when you are being treated like that?”\n\nWe did not like it, of course, but it helped us better understand the Nisga'a issue and understand how long aboriginals have been in that situation, and what should be done to correct that situation, to change it and turn the page so that these people can now decide their own future.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois showed its compassion and understanding. I think the Nisga'a will agree that we have always supported them. There are Nisga'a representatives here today, but I must warn them that they are in a turbulent zone and that the turbulence will keep increasing.\n\nI can promise members of the federal Liberal Party that this will get worse, probably tomorrow, if the minister introduces his bill. We are warning them. They need to tighten their seatbelts because I think we are in for quite a ride. If they have never seen what stuff Quebecers are made of, they will now. We are as proud to defend our people as the Nisga'a were to defend theirs. That is all I wanted to add.\n\nAs to the concept of a people, I also heard the member for Skeena earlier cite an eminent constitutional expert by the name of Tom Flanagan. Mr. Flanagan tabled a brief before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. Throughout the trip, I brought up the concept of peoples with those I met. Opponents of the bill have always thrown two arguments at us: the uncertainty caused by this debate and the agreement's lack of equality. We often hear that everyone must be equal in Canada.\n\nI asked Mr. Flanagan whether he believed that there were several nations and several peoples in Canada and his answer was that, like Pierre Elliott Trudeau, he thought that there was only one people in Canada, the Canadian people. So there was no point in supplementary questions on the rights of these nations, if we were hung up on that.\n\nI think that this is the trouble with the Reform Party. It does not think that there are other peoples and other nations in Canada. It is proving its point with the Nisga'a issue, as well as its stand with the members of the Liberal Party to put Quebec into a straitjacket. Reformers no more believe in the concept of a Nisga'a people than they believe in a people of Quebec. For them, everyone must be treated equally. Quebec is as important as Prince Edward Island.\n\nWe disagree completely on this and that is why we are perhaps in a better position to understand the native peoples' move toward autonomy because we are taking those same steps ourselves. It is easy for us to understand them. When aboriginals approach the Bloc Quebecois and announce that they are working for greater self-government, it is only natural that we understand where they are coming from.\n\nDuring my tour, I tested their concept of nation by asking people whether they believed that there were several nations and peoples in Canada. Their answer was yes. If there is recognition for this concept, it follows that these nations and peoples have specific rights. This is recognized in international law. With recognition as a people or nation comes recognition of specific rights.\n\nDefining specific rights requires partnership agreements. As we see it, the final Nisga'a agreement is a partnership agreement between two, even three peoples.",

The government should withdraw its allegations and let the member for Skeena—",

            "text": "I invite my colleagues to show respect to those members who speak in the House. If there is a point of order that concerns me, I will be glad to hear it. However, if a point of order is in no way related to my speech, I would ask members to wait until the end of my speech to raise it, if that is possible.\n\nI was talking about the concept of peoples and nations. I was saying that, if the Nisga'a are recognized as a nation or a people, or if Quebecers are recognized as a nation or a people, there are some specific rights that must be recognized and defined in a partnership agreement.\n\nThe Nisga'a treaty is exactly the type of partnership agreement that must exist between peoples. I was always supported in that belief, except by Mr. Flanagan, as I was saying earlier, who believed there was only one people in Canada, the Canadian people. Obviously, it is impossible to go very far in this assessment of reality.\n\nIf there is a partnership agreement, that creates some certainty, for people are wondering “What is going on with the aboriginal question, the land claims and the self-government issue?” That may be what creates the uncertainty. When a partnership agreement has been signed, people know exactly where things stand.\n\nAs for the question raised by the Reform Party on the importance of certainty and equality, I believed it was my duty to raise those same concepts in order to show that, in our opinion, their fears are unjustified.\n\nI also raised some points that were somewhat controversial throughout the discussions. One of these was the matter of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Some people hold that the charter does not apply.\n\nHowever, I brought out some interesting sections, including the one I want to quote here, section 9 of chapter 2. In it, it is stated in black and white that:\n\n...the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga'a Government in respect of all matters within its authority, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of Nisga'a Government as set out in this agreement.\n\nThe answer is, therefore, fairly clear to me. Is this agreement subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Well, that is set out in the agreement itself. There were also some fears expressed that it was not included in the act and that this could mean that it only applied loosely, but I shall explain later the link between the agreement and the act.\n\nIt seemed very important to me that an overview of the history of the charter was necessary in order to state that, yes, it is applicable. I have just read the exact passage where it is written that it applies, for those who say that it is not.\n\nNow for the protection of aboriginal women. This is another contentious issue that kept being raised throughout the proceedings and the bill clearly states that the provincial legislation will apply in this regard. The British Columbia legislation deals with all issues relating to the breakup of a marriage, including the division of matrimonial property. There is also similar legislation in Quebec.\n\nThere is definitely a major problem for those who are not parties to the Nisga'a treaty. I agree—and we raised this issue in the House before—that there is a problem for all other aboriginals, for all other reserves in Canada that come under the Indian Act. There is a grey area, a legal vacuum, as was illustrated several years ago by the Derickson ruling, in which a woman who had separated from her husband was not entitled to anything.\n\nThe court ruled that the matrimonial property act does not apply to reserves. The Indian affairs minister claims that he wants to settle this issue as quickly as possible. We raised it with the former minister and this is an urgent matter. But for the time being, it is also not true that, under the agreement, Nisga'a women are not protected.\n\nAnother very contentious issue is territorial overlap. As we know, there are many land claims in British Columbia. Reform Party members said that at the time 125% of British Columbia's territory was the subject of land claims by aboriginals because of this overlap.\n\nThere were aboriginal peoples that told us that the Nisga'a land claims overlapped their own. This is what we heard in Smithers, where the Gitksan and Gitanyow came to present their views.\n\nI have a number of comments. First, the Nisga'a also claimed 100% of their traditional lands but the final figure in the agreement was 7%. They settled for 2,000 square kilometres or 7% of what they had asked for.\n\nThe Government of British Columbia is taking a somewhat similar view. At the time, Mike Harcourt said that the Government of British Columbia was prepared to give up 5% of the province's territory to accommodate all native land claims in British Columbia.\n\nSeven per cent is not far off. The problem with the Gitksan and the Gitanyow is that they are still going after 100% of their traditional lands and naturally there is a part in the northern area of Nisga'a lands that the Gitksan say should belong to them.\n\nThere are A and B categories of lands—and I do not want to get into defining them—but there are lands where jurisdiction is more shared, and some of them are also being claimed by the Gitksan and Gitanyow.\n\nThis has been a bit complicated and very emotional because lands are involved. There were some very good presentations and here again I refer to the agreement.\n\nThe agreement contains provisions on what is to be done in case of overlapping claims. It must be pointed out that the Nisga'a had repeatedly tried to come to an agreement with the Gitskan and the Gitanyow on how to share this territory.\n\nWe have a letter signed by the eight hereditary chiefs of the Gitksan people showing that they had reached an agreement under which the northern border of the Nisga'a land was to be drawn the way it is today. We have no qualms about people making claims, but we are not always in a position to rule on everything.\n\nThe sections I am going to read say what is to be done. I will start with section 34.\n\nIf a superior court of a province, the Federal Court of Canada, or the Supreme Court of Canada finally determines that any aboriginal people, other than the Nisga'a Nation, has rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 that are adversely affected by a provision of this Agreement: a . the provision will operate and have effect to the extent that it does not adversely affect those rights; and b . if the provision cannot operate and have effect in a way that it does not adversely affect those rights, the Parties will make best efforts to amend this Agreement to remedy or replace the provision.\n\nThe section that follows, section 35, is very important: a . Canada or British Columbia, or both, as the case may be, will provide the Nisga'a Nation with additional or replacement rights or other appropriate remedies;\n\nThis is very clear. Whenever there is overlapping, the Gitskan and the Gitanyow can go to court. I just mentioned the various courts they can appeal to. If the courts tell them “You are right, these lands belong to you”, then what this section says to the Nisga'as who entered into this agreement and who will be dispossessed of these lands is that through British Columbia and the Parliament of Canada, they will receive other lands and compensation to make up for the loss of these lands.\n\nIn our opinion, this was enough to say that one could not prevent the conclusion of this final Nisga'a agreement based on possible overlapping we find it very difficult to assess. Let the courts rule on such matters. If the Gitksan and the Gitanyow feel they are disadvantaged and that part of their lands have been taken from them, they may go to court. If they make a good case and the courts decide they are right, then the Nisga'a will be compensated for losing part of these lands.\n\nIt was very important to be able to put this issue aside because it was one of the major issues we were faced with.\n\nMany people could say to me “As the member for Saint-Jean, you are referring to the final agreement, but that is not the act”. Some people say “We would like the provisions in the agreement to be transferred in the act”. On that point, the bill is again very explicit. I must point out two very important clauses stating that this final agreement is included in the act and even takes precedence over the act. I will read clause 4:\n\n4. (1) The Nisga'a Final Agreement is approved, given effect and declared valid and has the force of law.\n\nThe agreement I was referring to earlier has the force of law. Clause 6 goes even farther:\n\n6. In the event of an inconsistency or conflict between the Nisga'a Final Agreement and the provisions of any federal or provincial law, including this Act, that Agreement prevails to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict.\n\nThis is clear. The final agreement takes precedence over the act. It is included in the act, and in case of misinterpretation or if there are interpretations to be made between the act and the agreement, the latter will prevail. It is very clear and this refutes one of the arguments of our adversaries who say “What is included in the agreement is not necessarily included in the act”. I have just demonstrated the opposite.\n\nI could dwell on several provisions of the agreement, for example the whole issue of the fishery, where we will at last have some certainty about the fishery issue. It is not a quota. There is no determined number of pounds of salmon or shrimp or any other kind of fish that will be allowed, but a percentage of the fish stock in the Nass River, I think, is 27%.\n\nThat means that protection of the resource has been taken into consideration. The stock is protected in the sense that if, in a given year, the stock is low, the allowable catch will still be 27% but the amount of fish caught will be lower. If in the following year there is plenty of fish, the allowable catch will stay at 27%, but in that case the amount of fish caught will be higher.\n\nThe part on migratory birds is a very interesting one. The fish sector is also interesting because under the agreement the Nisga'a will have their say in developing the Canadian position in international negotiations. We believe that it is very important for a people, a nation, to have its say in the signing of international treaties.\n\nConsidering the numerous provisions included in the agreement to manage the situation, we believe that they will translate into certainties when the agreement is implemented after third reading and adoption in the Senate.\n\nProvisions concerning Nisga'a governments and relations with third parties are clear and precise.\n\nThere is another point I really must deal with. Some people said that there should be no taxation without representation. It is another myth that we have been hearing for a long time. Some people who are not Nisga'a will live on Nisga'a lands. They will not pay taxes to the Nisga'a government. They will continue to pay their taxes at the federal, provincial and municipal levels but they will pay no taxes to the Nisga'a. Therefore those people cannot demand to be part of the Nisga'a government if they do not pay taxes.\n\nThis was another argument that was often raised by the bill's opponents and I had to refute it.\n\nThere are also many other areas, such as economic and political activities defined in the accord, that ensure that there really is a partnership between parliament and the Nisga'a nation.\n\nWe white people often tend to have a certain conception of values. I recall that when Mr. Bouchard named me critic for Indian affairs, I wondered what I was going to do. I discovered that the issue of Indian affairs was an extremely important one because it forces us to look into our hearts and it greatly changes us.\n\nI think it also changes our values system. For us, the measure of one's success is often having a Mercedes, a mansion, a cottage and a big bank account. The Nisga'a and other native peoples do not have the same values.\n\nI am really happy when these people give me the opportunity to discover new values. It makes me happy when they take me fishing salmon in their boat for part of the day. For me, that is very important. It is a concept of values that we white people forgot long ago.\n\nIf more of my colleagues went fishing with the natives there would be less arguing in the House. People's values would probably change and animosity would probably disappear.\n\nOne has to see how these people react to animosity, to all those rednecks yelling at them to speak white or telling them to go back to their reserves, as we heard before. Almost all of these people went to residential schools. They have a great inner peace because they all experienced a lot of problems. Today they are enthusiastic and determined to conclude these agreements. They are immune to all the snide remarks and insults hurled at them. They are convinced that they will succeed, and having been around them, I too am convinced that they will.\n\nIt is the Mercedes versus the small boat to go salmon fishing, the Mercedes versus the moose hunt, the fishing camp versus the mansion. But, as far as I am concerned, one can certainly be as happy in a fishing camp as in a castle on the Loire because communing with nature is easier.\n\nThese people taught me that. As for gathering berries, they have always taken me to the places where the best berries are to be found. They are probably better than the ones served at banquets in the Château Laurier here in Ottawa because they are eaten in the wild and in a traditional way that we do not know about.\n\nI find that the values that these people help us discover are important. Nature is important for them. It is important for them to live happily in the wild and in perfect harmony with nature.\n\nI started my speech by saying that the Bloc Quebecois was willing to take one of the keys and to open the cage in which the Nisga'a people have been locked for several centuries now. The Indian Act is at least 125 years old. They have been subject to this act since the beginning. It is important for us to accompany the Nisga'a people on the road to self-government. In fact, we said, in the language of the Nisga'a:\n\n[Editor's note: The member spoke in Nisga'a]\n\nThat means “We walk with the Nisga'a people”.\n\nWe never stopped walking with the Nisga'a people since the beginning, but now I also want the Nisga'a people to understand, and they are here today, that we are going through some turbulence, as I said this earlier, and if we are happy that they obtained their autonomy, the greatest autonomy possible, we, the Bloc Quebecois, are very unhappy with the turn of events concerning our own people. People must understand each other.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Reform Party denies the existence of several nations in Canada. It is quite obvious that the Reform Party wants to gag Quebec, to lock it up, like the Liberal Party, in the cage of status quo. We, too, want out of this cage. The Nisga'a people must understand that Quebec wants out of this cage, that it wants to free itself from this trap, that it wants to look to the future from a different perspective, from the perspective that I explained earlier, whereby a sovereign Quebec will maintain a partnership with its Canadian friends and with the native people with whom we have shared the same territory for a very long time.\n\nConsequently, we have to increase the opportunities for partnership. It is not acceptable to say to Quebecers “We are locking you up in a cage and throwing away the key; you will stay there and nothing will change”. We gave up the idea of changing things a long time ago. We believe that we must achieve full independence now, and that is why we have some mixed feelings today.\n\nWe are happy for the Nisga'a people. Obviously the Bloc does not want to block this bill. We cannot do that to a people that is moving toward self-government. However, as I mentioned earlier, there are distortions and zones of turbulence.\n\nThat is why I move the following motion:\n\nThat the House do now adjourn.",

This progress is very real but, unfortunately, it is jeopardized by scourges such as AIDS and military conflicts.\n\nThe report calls on governments around the world, and on our collective and individual conscience, to find concrete solutions to the problems experienced by children all over the world.\n\nCanada is making great efforts to alleviate human suffering. For example, our country is taking part in several military missions to maintain peace in various parts of the world. We also contributes to economic and social development projects in poor countries.\n\nA tremendous amount of work remains to be done to reduce human suffering. However, we can be proud of the leadership role played by our government in improving the quality of life of children around the world.",

What was even more revealing were comments made by Liberal members of the committee. Perhaps they should have checked with the minister before speaking.\n\nThe Liberal committee chairman stated “AIDA has been an absolute failure and we have got to get out of the ad hoc programs”.

At the outset, I would like to tell the men and women who work for the Canadian transportation industry that my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois and myself, as the transport critic for the Bloc, are very concerned with the uncertainty they now experience, a few days only before Christmas.\n\nThis has been particularly true for a number of months, more precisely since August 13 when the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Industry, by suspending the provisions of the Competition Act, created total chaos in the Canadian transportation industry. This situation recently led to the shutdown of operations at InterCanadian, and 900 workers and their families, could perhaps be forced in the very near future to go on welfare.\n\nI think that 14 days before Christmas we, as parliamentarians, cannot remain insensitive to the gloomy situation faced by the workers of InterCanadian, a company based in Montreal.\n\nI could talk for a long time about the content of this report, but I will of course be able to revisit it in the future. Since I am running short on time, am allowed only 20 minutes to make a speech and have already been talking for two minutes, I would like to turn immediately to the second part of my speech since I am afraid to run out of time.\n\nFor the benefit of the members in the House and of our viewers, and I know that there are quite a few of them, I would like to go back to a statement made by a person who said “No matter what, Quebec is and will always be a distinct and free society capable of assuming its own destiny and development”.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I was just about to talk about the 10% ownership rule in Air Canada. I hope that I will not be interrupted. That rule is essential to maintain a broad shareholder base.\n\nI want to explain that the Bloc does not support the majority report of the Liberals, who want to raise that percentage to 20%. That would have the effect of giving effective control to a single shareholder or a group of shareholders. If we want to maintain a broad shareholder base, we absolutely must keep the 10% limit.\n\nWe read in The Gazette “The Liberal hon. member for Vaudreuil said the following. Personally, I think that the limit should not be set at 20%, because that would give the separatist Caisse de dépôt control over Air Canada”.\n\nAcross the way, there are people, like the member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, who will charter buses, just as at the time of the last referendum in 1995, three days before the next referendum, for crowds to come and tell us they love us. Do you think Quebecers are gullible enough to believe such a thing once again?\n\nThat reminds me of those members from the Reform Party who were lucky enough to get Canadian Airlines tickets. At the time of the last referendum, Canadian Airlines chartered 747 planes and people came from Vancouver to Montreal, three days before the referendum, just to participate in the love parade.\n\nYou want me to speak about air transportation? Let us do so. VIA Rail changed its name; it is now VIA Rail Canada and its engines bear a logo with a big maple leaf. They speak about transportation, but they will not let me finish my speech. I am an impulsive person. I wonder if you have realized that, Mr. Speaker.\n\nThe Standing Committee on Transport voted upon a second rule.\n\nBefore the President of the Treasury Board leaves, I want to say I am convinced she will agree with me that the 10% ownership rule at Air Canada should not be modified. I am sure she is a true Quebecer, and I am sure she will be against changing that rule.\n\nUnfortunately, since she left the House, I cannot say she is not here, but I want to say there is another important element in this report from the Standing Committee on Transport. It is the 25% foreign ownership rule, which the Liberal majority wants to increase to 49%. This means that Americans could control up to 49% of the airline industry.\n\nThis creates a totally ironic situation whereby members from the Bloc Quebecois agree that the foreign ownership rule should remain as it is, and the limit be maintained at 25%. Believe it or not, we will respect the partnership between an independent and sovereign Quebec and the rest of Canada. We are so respectful that we are opposing the 49% rule in order to promote Canada's sovereignty against the Americans.\n\nIf we accept the increase to 49%, there will more situations such as those we already witnessed, for example American Airlines which held large blocks of shares and which transferred the positions of machinists, repairmen, and maintenance employees from Vancouver and Calgary to the United States.\n\nThe Liberal majority pointed out that it agreed to increase the percentage because we apparently need foreign capital. There is not enough solid capital to justify ownership in Canada, wealth in Canada. And yet one of the proudest achievements of Quebecers, the Caisse de dépôt, is ready to invest in Air Canada, not to take control of it. The Caisse de dépôt's role is to ensure that the savings of Quebecers earn a return so as to provide a future for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nThat is the role of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. This is not like the derogatory comments of the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges who says that he does not want the limit raised to 20% because he does not want to see the separatist Caisse de dépôt take control of Air Canada. These are unacceptable remarks coming from a Quebecer like the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, who is as much a Quebecer as I am. That does not prevent him from saying this kind of things. That is where the inconsistency is: it is acceptable for Americans to control Air Canada but not the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.",

            "text": "The Standing Committee on Transport does not say a word either on air safety. I will finish on a darker note, a little bit more serious—although I should not say serious, because I have been serious since the beginning—but I have making my points in a more casual way. What I want to say is that this report does not say a word about the lack of safety in numerous regional airports. Unfortunately, in the last year and a half, many people have lost their lives in Baie-Comeau, Gaspe and Sept-Îles because Nav Canada closed down control towers.\n\nThe transport minister, answering a letter sent to him by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, said “The ministry is prepared to accept and tolerate an acceptable risk”. But what is an acceptable risk? Is it playing Russian roulette? Is every Quebecer travelling in regions of Quebec, such as the Lower St. Lawrence, Gaspe, North Shore, Abitibi or Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, entitled to safe regional air transportation? Do we say “I hope I will not be subjected to unacceptable risk because if that is the case, my plane could crash on the account of there being no air traffic controller”. This should have be mentioned in the report.\n\nThe last issue I would like to talk about is this: the Bloc Quebecois asked that regional airlines be subject to the Official Languages Act, as is the main airline, Air Canada. As members know, in the regions of Quebec, 98% of the customers are francophones. Flight attendants act as a link between the pilot and the passengers and are in charge of safety on board. The primary function of a flight attendant is not, as many people think, to serve meals and drinks, but to ensure safety.\n\nIt is not enough for flight attendants to know the usual speech and say “Exits are above the wings and lavatories are at the back”. A first grader, the young daughter of my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, for example, if taught properly, could say that in front of 700 or 800 people.\n\nIt is one thing to teach that to a first grader, but it is quite another to act in an emergency situation like the one we had recently where a Focker 28 from Canadian Regional on a flight from Quebec to Montreal had trouble with its front landing gear and the flight attendant had to go through the emergency landing procedures. And she only spoke English. She knew the usual speech. But when the time came to tell passengers to take off their eyeglasses, their dentures and their shoes and to assume a foetal position, she could not do it. It takes a flight attendant who is capable of communicating in both official languages.\n\nI will finish with a quote that goes back to the second point I raised in my speech. Unfortunately, you interrupted me, but we will have the opportunity to talk about it again later this week. I barely touched on the subject in my speech today.\n\nSomeone said that it is up to Quebecers to decide, that the federal government is wrong to try at all costs to impose a way through the courts. This is what Gordon Wilson, constitutional adviser to the Premier of British Columbia, said on February 5, 1998.\n\nI will conclude with a quote from another journalist from Beauport from the 19th century, when Quebecers were called French Canadians. This journalist from Beauport by the name of Étienne Parent said “It is the fate of the French Canadian people not only to try to keep their fundamental freedoms, but also to fight for their very existence as a people. If we do not govern ourselves, we will be governed”.",

The motion reads as follows:\n\nThat, in the opinion of this House, the government should examine the financial assistance available to airports under the Airport Capital Assistance Program, and on what terms, and consider the possibility of extending the Program to operating costs in order to sustain the provision of air transportation services at airports in the riding of Abitibi—James Bay—Nunavik, including the regional airport—",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am very proud to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-9, the Nisga'a final agreement, at third reading. I am proud to say that all members of the federal NDP caucus have supported Bill C-9, and have been very supportive of the process and the debate that has taken place. We have stood firmly in support of the Nisga'a final agreement.\n\nI would like to recognize the work of our aboriginal affairs spokesperson, the member for Yukon. She has played a very positive role at committee with her thoughtful comments, her experience and her deep understanding of aboriginal affairs. I would like to pay special thanks to her for her very dedicated work and participation in the process.\n\nBeing from British Columbia, I would like to put on the record that the work of our provincial government on the Nisga'a agreement and on the negotiations which took place also needs to be acknowledged. Two former premiers, Michael Harcourt and Glen Clark, really made this a centrepiece of their agendas. They were personally very committed to seeing a redress of the wrongs that had been done in the past and seeking social and economic justice for the Nisga'a people. Mike Harcourt, Glen Clark, Ian Waddell, the MLA who chaired the B.C. legislative committee that went around the province, as well as Dale Lovick, the current minister of aboriginal affairs for B.C., did a very good job.\n\nIt has to be recognized that they took on this job and were faced with a lot of political opportunism, which was seen to be more politically expedient than achieving justice, by the B.C. Liberal Party and the federal Reform Party.\n\nI toyed with the idea of also thanking another former premier of British Columbia, Mr. Vander Zalm, who actually brought the provincial government to the negotiating table in 1991. However, after seeing what he did in the last few years I do not think I could thank him. He basically trashed aboriginal people and the Nisga'a agreement. When the committee was in Vancouver he played a role in the games that were played with his little demonstration. Mr. Vander Zalm brought in the people who hurled obscenities, while he sat there apparently in agreement. He has not played a positive role. He too has sunk to the level of his federal colleagues in the Reform Party in seeing this issue as political opportunism.\n\nMost of all, I would like to thank the Nisga'a people for their patience, not just today with the entire process that has unfolded in the House, but for their patience over the last 20 years and that of the generations before them. If we look back and reflect on the oppression that aboriginal and Nisga'a people suffered and the fact that they had the faith to negotiate an agreement, we know that this is something that is very historic and needs to be acknowledged, particularly in light of what has been a very difficult debate. Horrific statements have been made and thrown at them.\n\nI particularly want to thank Joe Gosnell, the leader of the Nisga'a people, as well as the teams of negotiators. As we were doing our business in the House they kept faith in the process. I am sure there were ups and downs. I am sure there were days when they thought that maybe this would not work and people had to compromise. The fact is that the federal, provincial and Nisga'a negotiators arrived at the agreement which is before us today.\n\nEarlier we heard from Reform members that they believe part of the negotiation process which unfolded was somehow a stacked deal, that it was all done behind closed doors. We have said this many times on the record, and let it be said again: no piece of legislation has had as much scrutiny, examination, debate and public hearing as the Nisga'a agreement in principle as well as the final agreement. We know that for the 20 years that negotiations took place, especially the last few years, advisory committees were involved and public hearings were held by various organizations. For example, the labour movement in British Columbia was involved in the advisory committees. It held consultations with its membership on the treaty to get feedback. We have heard the same thing from the business community, as well as the aboriginal community.\n\nThe member for Skeena earlier today said that this was a stacked process which was carried out behind closed doors. I cannot think of anything further from the truth in terms of what really took place. Committee hearings were held in B.C. and in Ottawa.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves what this agreement is about. There are many ways to sum it up. I believe this agreement is important and significant. It provides the opportunity for the Nisga'a people to assert themselves as a people, to realize their rights, to undertake their own affairs in economic terms, in social terms, in cultural terms and in terms of equality.\n\nThe agreement allows the Nisga'a people to redress the wrongs of the past. It allows the Nisga'a people to develop a stewardship of the land and it allows them to develop resource based management from which all Canadians will learn.\n\nThe Nisga'a agreement is within the Canadian constitution. It burns me to hear Reform members spreading information again and again that somehow the agreement is illegal.\n\nEarlier today we again heard the member for Skeena say that the Nisga'a final agreement is legislated segregation. In fact the member went on to equate legislated segregation with apartheid. This is really disgusting. I feel that it displays an astounding arrogance.\n\nThe member is suggesting to the Nisga'a people that they have accepted a system of apartheid. He has a lot of arrogance to say that after 20 years of negotiation. This agreement is about equality and social justice. This agreement is within the Canadian constitution. I do not know the response to these comments, but to use these terms, to use the word apartheid, to use the term legislated segregation, is a denial of what has really taken place.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves why there has been such a vitriolic response. Even today I was still receiving e-mails full of hatred, viciousness, meanness and racial overtones. I ask myself where this information is coming from. We have to admit, unfortunately, that some of the information comes from the media, which has bought into certain arguments of the Reform Party and its cohort in British Columbia, the B.C. Liberal Party. These messages have been repeated over and over until the people have begun to believe them.\n\nWithin the media there has also been some very reasoned, thoughtful and reflective debate which has tried to present the agreement as something that can be examined. Yes, there are some criticisms and there are some issues. This is not a perfect document. We should acknowledge that in the sea of misinformation and a campaign full of misrepresentation and divisiveness some members of the media have tried to ensure that there was a balanced debate.\n\nToday we heard the member for Skeena say that the Reform Party was trying to shed light on the Nisga'a final agreement. What does that mean? I came to the conclusion that Reform members have not shed any light on the Nisga'a final agreement; they have only shed darkness. That is what has been very upsetting about the process which we have gone through. Misinformation has been peddled to the media and the message has gone out again and again that somehow women's rights will not be upheld, that this is a constitutional amendment through the back door, that it will be taxation without representation, that it will be legislated separation, that it will be apartheid, and on and on it goes. That is not shedding light; that is conducting a campaign of fear.\n\nWhen are Reform members going to stop putting out information that is incorrect, information that is designed to divide people and exploit people's fears about change and about what is taking place? From that point of view, it has been a process that has in some ways brought out the best in terms of public debate and certainly has been a model of what negotiation should be about. However, it has also been a public process, regrettably, that has brought out the worst in some people and the worst in some members of the House.\n\nI have supported this agreement from the beginning. I have to say that the Nass Valley is many hundreds of miles from my riding of Vancouver East. I do not have a direct physical connection with that part of British Columbia. However, I feel that there is a very significant link between what happens in the Nass Valley to the Nisga'a people and what happens in my riding of Vancouver East. My riding also contains a very large population of urban aboriginal people. As we know, something like 60% of aboriginal people live off reserve because they have been oppressed by the system, by the way we have conducted affairs through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.\n\nThis agreement provides a way to open up a new door. It is a way for government to sit down in equal partnership with aboriginal people and say that it is going to change the way it does business, that it will be on the basis of equality and that it will be on the basis of justice.\n\nI support the Nisga'a final agreement. To me it is a step forward. However, it is not the end of the road. In some ways it is only the beginning. I am not saying that the agreement is a “one size fits all” for all of B.C. or all of Canada. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe process is important. The process that was conducted needs to be repeated in terms of arriving at negotiated settlements; not conflict and litigation through the courts, such as we have seen on our east coast.\n\nTaking that step forward is a sign of hope. It is a sign that federal representatives, provincial representatives and aboriginal representatives can sit down, work out very complex issues and arrive at something with which we can all live. I hope that we continue along that path. I hope too that we recognize that urban aboriginal people are also in great distress and that their issues need to be addressed.\n\nI ask the government to consider that. We had the royal commission on aboriginal affairs. I do not know how much dust the report is collecting, but it is a job that we need to get on with. There are people in my riding who are literally dying on the street. There are people who are suffering from addiction. There are people who are living in substandard housing. There are people who are living far below the poverty line and are struggling to survive each and every day. It takes a lot of courage and survival skills to do that.\n\nIt is important that we see this agreement as a step in a process, a step along the road in dealing as well with those other issues that are very important.\n\nWhen the member for Skeena concluded his remarks he said that the Nisga'a final agreement was not a good deal for the Nisga'a people. I thought about that. I assume that the member believed what he said, that it is not a good deal for the Nisga'a people. We have to be very careful about the kinds of conclusions we come to.\n\nThis is not something that was put together over a few days. This is not something that was prepared by the federal government, the department or the provincial government, which then said “Take it or leave it”. This was a process in which an agreement was negotiated. It was the Nisga'a people themselves, their leadership and the members of that community, who finally at the end of the day decided that this was a good deal. Maybe it is not all they had hoped for. They made many compromises, but it is an agreement they can live with and an agreement they can build their lives with. It is an agreement they can pass on to their children and say that they did the right thing, that they are building and creating their future.\n\nThe member for Skeena is dead wrong when he says that it is not a good deal for the Nisga'a people. He needs to go into that community and talk to people. He will find out that it was approved by a very large majority. History will show us 10 or 20 years from now that this was the right way to do something, that it was far preferable to conflict in a legal sense and in a political sense.\n\nI am very proud today that I and all of our members in the federal caucus are supporting this agreement. There has been a lot of stuff out in the media. We have all had responses from some people, but at the end of the day it is important to stand up and do the right thing. The right thing here is to support the agreement, say that it is a step forward and that it is the right step forward.",

She slags anybody who disagrees not on the basis of the issue or not on the basis of the substance of the treaty but on the basis that we somehow have dark motives, that we are somehow people of lower moral character because we do not agree with the government's policy direction. That is the first thing I predicted would happen.\n\nShe admitted in her intervention that the agreement is flawed but did not talk at all about what the flaws are in the agreement. She totally discounted the expert advice we received from constitutional legal experts, such as Mel Smith, Professor Stephen Scott, Professor Tom Flanagan and a host of others. She glossed right over that and said that irrespective of what these people have told us as parliamentarians that she is right, that somehow she has elevated herself to be a constitutional expert and an expert on the charter of rights because she says so and that is just the way it is.\n\nI will ask the member a legitimate question. If she is so sure that this is not an extra-constitutional document, that this document does not violate the constitution, which is the subject of two separate legal challenges in British Columbia, that the charter of rights and freedoms applies and that the charter of rights of the Nisga'a people will not be diminished under this agreement, why would she and her party not support the one amendment we wanted last week above all other amendments, the amendment to guarantee that the Constitution of Canada and the charter of rights and freedoms would apply and that the self-government provisions in chapter 11 would not be constitutionally entrenched? Why did she not support the one amendment that would have guaranteed a higher likelihood of the charter applying and a lower likelihood of this being seen as a back door amending of the constitution?\n\nWhy was she and her party not prepared to support that one amendment? Of all the other defects and flaws in the treaty, that was the one we wanted. We are not happy with many of the other defects, but that was one that we felt was important to have so that if there are any problems in the future, and we know there will be problems, they can be fixed. Why was she not prepared to do that?",

I, like other members, rely on all of the opinions that come before us, from the committee as well as information we receive.\n\nI would be very surprised if there was any legal issue in Canada where we could find a whole bunch of lawyers all agreeing on the same thing. Of course there were other opinions, but we have to look at the overall body of evidence. Surely that is what we do as parliamentarians. We look at the history of our country and come to a rational, reasonable conclusion as to whether or not something is right in terms of the constitution. A vast majority of the members in the House, in fact four of the political parties present, came to that conclusion because it was logical and reasonable.\n\nThe Reform Party can of course find someone who will disagree with that, but the overwhelming evidence and opinion in the country is that the Nisga'a agreement is perfectly within the Canadian constitution.\n\nI do not think I ever said that the agreement was flawed. I said it was not perfect. Is anything perfect? Is anything in the House perfect? I do not think so, but it is a pretty good document. When we go through it and think of what it took to get to that point, it is as near to perfect as anything can get when there is that kind of process. It is not a flawed document. I wish the member would not misrepresent what I said.\n\nIn terms of the amendments that came forward, we went through that charade for many hours? There has been a lot of debate in the House. It is clear that we make up our own minds about what we think is right or whether or not something is constitutional. I can inform the member that the members of the NDP believe very strongly and firmly that the agreement is within the constitution. We therefore did not see the need for any further amendments.

The member did an excellent job in chairing those meetings.\n\nIn the committee meetings I attended, I thought the discussions, questions and debates were of an excellent nature. It was the best of what we can expect in terms of parliamentarians doing their work. They listened to the criticisms. There were criticisms as there is on everything. The thoughtful responses and the questions that were provided were very important. Unfortunately, I do not think that was true of the Reform Party which played a very different kind of game. It was executing a political agenda. Fortunately, at the end of the day, it did not managed to get that through and this agreement will be approved and the work of the committee and the members in the House will see that is done.

As I said, the difference with this bill is that clause 6 makes no reference to a carryover but instead provides for a two year window to spend from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2001. This is against our financial procedures as explained in Beauchesne's citation 933.\n\nThe Public Accounts of Canada must refer back to the authorities voted by parliament if the public accounts are to make any sense to parliamentarians and the appropriation which they voted to the crown. If parliament approves two years together then how can parliamentarians properly examine spending for one fiscal year?\n\nI am trying to be brief but I have to get the complex argument on the record. The President of the Treasury Board said in the House on April 24, 1996, at page 1903 of Debates :\n\n—an example of our proposal to amend the Financial Administration Act to allow us to use multi-year appropriation. If approved, we could use this authority with the three agencies where flexibility is warranted.\n\nHowever, in Your Honour's ruling of June 8, 1999, you said that the notions of fiscal year and annual appropriation are the cornerstones of our parliamentary financial process. The government wants to change our practice and exceed its authority by seeking multi-year appropriation.\n\nIn addition, the title does not reflect what is in the bill. The title reads “an act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the public service of Canada for the financial year ending March 31, 2000”. Yet the bill contains the specific authority to spend funds up to and including March 31, 2001, with no reference whatsoever that it pertains to funds to be carried over from the year ending March 31, 2000. Beauchesne's citation 626 states:\n\nAlthough there is no specific set of rules or guidelines governing the content of a bill, there should be a theme of relevancy among the contents of a bill. They must be relevant to and subject to the umbrella, which is raised by the terminology of the long title of the bill.\n\nI am almost finished.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it has been a long day. Many of us have waited in the House to speak to this very important piece of legislation. I am certainly proud on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to speak to Bill C-9.\n\nWith respect to the intervention by the hon. member who spoke previously, which I am sure was an enlightened and intelligent intervention, I would like to comment that the only time I ever heard a sound like that it came out of the south end of a dog that was headed north.\n\nIt is time that we debated this issue. It is past time that we debated this issue. We have stood in the House on numerous occasions and talked about the substance of the Nisga'a bill. We have talked about the legislation. We have talked about how it affects taxation, how it affects the charter of rights and freedoms, and how it affects the constitution of Canada.\n\nI listened to the hon. member for Skeena speak about the constitution of Canada. I heard him state in this place that this changes the constitution of Canada. That is exactly what was said, and I have heard it from other members of parliament.\n\nFor the members of parliament who have read the legislation, I ask them to turn to page 17 where it references the constitution of Canada. It states in section 8 that this agreement does not alter the constitution of Canada. That is fairly straightforward, clear and pertinent to this discussion.\n\nIn subsection 8(a) it goes on to explain it further. This is the type of debate that should be raised. Members should read the statements and the sections of the agreement with which hon. members have a problem. They should be put before the country so that Canadians will hear what we are all listening to and make a reasoned and rational decision. I have no fear whatsoever about depending upon the good, common sense of Canadians when they hear all the points in this issue.\n\nI will read some of the points in the legislation that have been singled out and have been, I think, misinterpreted by members of parliament. I will also describe why I believe they have been misinterpreted. Subsection 8(a) says:\n\nThis Agreement does not alter the Constitution of Canada, including: a. the distribution of powers between Canada and British Columbia; b. the identity of the Nisga'a Nation as an aboriginal people of Canada within the meaning of the Constitution Act, 1982; and c. sections 25 and 35 of the\n\nConstitution Act, 1982.\n\nIt says further:\n\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga'a Government in respect of all matters within its authority, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of Nisga'a Government as set out in this Agreement.\n\nThat is the same way that the charter of rights and freedoms applies to all democratic societies and governments in the country. There is nothing new there. There is no hidden design. I said in debate before that the earth will not open up and swallow British Columbia, not for a moment.\n\nThere have been other discussions on the bill. It is very important that we take those discussions a step further, that we look at them in the cold, clear light of day and debate them.\n\nI have no problem with debating the bill. I will debate the bill until Easter without any problem whatsoever but I want to debate the bill. I do not want to debate some fictional caricature of this piece of legislation that on a good day is misleading and on a bad day totally affects the hard work starting in 1887 of the Nisga'a people, the province of British Columbia, the Nisga'a chiefs and successive governments of Canada. Negotiations were entered into in good faith.\n\nThe legislation deals with all those issues. Like any series of negotiations there is some give and take. The Nisga'a did not get the agreement they started out asking for, and perhaps on the government side it did not get the agreement either. However in negotiations we ended up with an agreement that is workable. The key ingredient for me is that we ended with an agreement that has some flexibility. This is not entrenched in the proverbial constitutional concrete that we keep hearing about. This agreement is protected by the constitution. It is not a part of the constitution of Canada.\n\nI do not know how many times that has to be said in this place before someone will actually listen to the argument. It is easy to say no. It is easy to say I do not believe that, but if we look at the facts, study the legislation, talk to the legal experts, listen to the informed and often very good debate that occurred in the House on the treaty, we will come to understand that there are significant issues within the treaty that I believe are a template for other treaties.\n\nThere are parts of this treaty that I would hope will become a template for further treaties in the country. There are parts of this treaty that we should have as a template.\n\nThere is the fact that the Constitution of Canada prevails. The charter of rights and freedoms prevails. The interests of women and children are protected. The Nisga'a will own their land, and let me be very clear about this, fee simple.\n\nThere is no such thing as fee simple common. I do not know what that is. That term has been made up. That is one of the myths about this legislation that has been thrown out in debate. Hon. members use it and never have to back it up. They can sit down after they are finished in debate and say, “I have said it and I don't have to back it up. I don't have to go anywhere and defend what I am saying”. I have defended what I have said on this bill on numerous occasions and I am very happy to defend it one more time.\n\nThe issue of jurisdiction is extremely important. It is important for parliamentarians to protect the jurisdiction of the crown. It is important for parliamentarians to protect the jurisdiction of the province of British Columbia. Because we have entered into a treaty process with first nations in this country, it is important to protect future jurisdictions that will look at this treaty. It is not a template but we can look at many parts of this treaty with satisfaction and a great deal of pride and say we have done our duty as parliamentarians. We have protected the interests of Canadians.\n\nWe have put aside a historic wrong against the Nisga'a people. It started in 1887 when the Nisga'a chiefs paddled their canoes to the B.C. legislature. Hon. members should picture this in their minds. The chiefs dragged the canoes up on the beach, walked to the legislature, knocked on the door and were refused entry. It is unbelievable.\n\nWe have continued under the auspices of the Indian Act and other pieces of legislation to, I believe, inhibit opportunities for first nations.\n\nAn hon. member referred to Bill C-49. What a novel thought in Bill C-49 that first nations would be in charge, in control of and responsible for the land on their reserves. Several cases have arisen out of some of the legislation in Bill C-49, but here is the principle that land that we own or any first nation owns is their land to do with what they want to, as long as they obey the laws of Canada and the territory or province they are in, that they recognize stewardship and that they look after the environment.\n\nNone of us have a spotless record in this place, no group, no party, no individual. We can only work with the facts in front of us. We can only deal with one point at a time. It is great to shove all these points together and somehow throw them out, as if they were broadcasting grain to see which ones will grow and which ones will take root. They nourish those and divide them, spreading fear and innuendo and causing Canadians to ask if there is something wrong with this. Have we passed a piece of legislation in the House of Commons that does not protect the interests of ordinary Canadians? Absolutely not. We have not. That has not been done.\n\nThere is the issue of jurisdiction. There is the very important issue of overlap between the Gitksan and the Nisga'a, and the possible overlap with the Gitanyow.\n\nI sat in Smithers and listened to the debate. The record was quoted earlier today. Any Canadian who would like to look at that debate should get a copy of the record and read it. They should read the questions that were asked about possible conflict and if there could be violence. Everything was done that could be done to get one first nation to take a stand against another, one Canadian against another Canadian, one community against another community, sowing the seeds of discontent.\n\nAs a private landowner and as a farmer I have been in numerous land disputes. Some of them were not very pretty. In some of those disputes harsh words were said, but at the end of the day there was never any intent on anyone's part not to somehow negotiate a fair and equitable settlement for everyone.\n\nCanadians respect the rule of law. The Nisga'a people respect the rule of law. The province of British Columbia respects the rule of law. At the end of the day the issues of division that still lay undecided in this treaty will be settled because there is a process to settle them. It is not a complicated process and it is clearly laid out in the agreement. On every issue the Nisga'a final agreement prevails. Even if that part of the legislation is not carried over to the government's legislation, it still goes back to the Nisga'a final agreement and the Nisga'a final agreement prevails.\n\nFor those of us who have debated it, studied it and worked on it literally for months and months, there is nothing shocking here. There is nothing untoward. Hon. members talk about 14 areas where the Nisga'a will have more jurisdiction than the province of British Columbia or the Government of Canada. I would suggest that members read those issues, read those 14 areas. There is absolutely nothing shocking in the agreement. There is nothing there that takes away rights from ordinary Canadians. There is nothing there that allows for taxation without representation. That is patently untrue.\n\nThe taxation agreement with Canada and the province of British Columbia will allow the Nisga'a government to tax Nisga'a citizens. It absolutely does not allow the Nisga'a government to tax non-Nisga'a citizens. It is pretty simple. It even goes so far as to state that in the event that the Nisga'a sell a piece of their property to a non-Nisga'a, because Nisga'a property will be owned fee simple and the band or a member has every right to sell a piece of Nisga'a land, that is their land, they own it, then we go back to the agreement and the jurisdiction will rest for taxation in the hands of the province of British Columbia, not with the Nisga'a government. There is no way we can have taxation without representation. It goes on and on and on.\n\nMost of us were here the other night and we voted. Certainly we showed up for the final vote. Reform members have made a big ruckus of party solidarity on this. I counted the votes on Motion No. 471. I was in the House. Thirty-nine members of the Reform Party voted. I believe if we check the record there are more Reform members than that. I know some of them were tired and I understand that. It is not inconceivable that members of parliament missed that last vote because it was tough. There is no question about it. Thirty-nine members voted. I do not think it is all love and apple pie in the Reform caucus either. I think there are some serious problems there.\n\nWe have dealt with jurisdiction. We have dealt with a number of issues. Let us talk for a moment about the fishery. Let us look at the fishery agreement which allows the Nisga'a government 27% of the TAC on the Nass River and 16% of the total TAC, that is offshore TAC.\n\nI have heard this called a race based fishery. I would have to agree with that if the Nisga'a had 100% of the fishery on the Nass River. As long as they do not have 100%—and they do not, they have 27%—it cannot be a race based fishery. Other people will benefit from the stewardship programs introduced by the Nisga'a.\n\nAs I have said in the House before, having 27% of the total salmon catch on the Nass River is the same as having 27% of nothing, unless the stock is nurtured and allowed to reproduce and the government does not allow them to be caught on the high seas and they actually get to return to the rivers and spawn. If the resource is looked after, if the salmon population were to double, 27% is very significant. However, the remaining 73% for everyone else would also double.\n\nIt is a very fair agreement. It was worked out over time and with great difficulty. If we used this agreement as a template and applied it to every river in B.C., it would still keep the native fishery at 27%. It might be divided between five or six bands. It might be more. It might be 40%. This is why we have negotiations.\n\nThis is not a race based fishery. We as members of parliament are not encouraging some type of apartheid system. It is completely and unequivocally irresponsible and patently wrong and misleading to state that.\n\nWhat is nonsense about this treaty is the number of people I have talked to who are adamantly against it yet they have not read it. They do not understand it and have not listened to one single word of debate. There is always give and take in negotiations. There is always give and take in debate. A good point can always be made. However, it is a lot easier to take cheap shots, to make an outlandish statement and say this treaty is apartheid. That is repugnant to the majority of Canadians. After listening to a member of parliament who should be respected by all Canadians use that word, how many Canadians would feel their skin crawl or their hair stand up on the back of their neck? I would suggest every single one.\n\nThis treaty deals with all of the pertinent issues which affect first nations in Canada. It is a tribute to the Nisga'a chiefs and their predecessors who worked long and hard on this treaty. I think it is a tribute to the Parliament of Canada. Many members of parliament were against this treaty and I do not have a problem with that. I have a problem with the fact that it was not debated. I have a problem with closure. I would have continued debating it until Easter without a problem and if we had to go longer than that, we would do so.\n\nWhen we answer questions one at a time, and after reading the treaty, a lot of substance is removed from that argument. A lot of substance leaves the argument that people are mad and they can drive wedges into society and they can take a wrecking ball to public policy platforms.\n\nOn behalf of the Conservative Party, I am happy to support the treaty. Our party will continue to support the treaty. I expect that in 10 years we will look back and say that this was a great treaty.",

When the Liberals say that we have done a good thing, our spider sense has to tingle a little bit. We are on different sides here.\n\nWith respect, it was obviously a treaty that we could all agree on. The greatest thing about this particular piece of legislation and the greatest mistruths that have been stated by the Reform members was to compare the fear that Canadians have that there will possibly be one group of Canadians that will have more rights than another group. They threw that bone out, it did not go anywhere and they tried it again. In my opinion, this treaty does not do that.\n\nIt is the fear people have in eastern Canada when they look at a very difficult situation going on with the Mi'kmaq over the 1760 treaty. They feel that somehow this will not be settled in an amicable way and we will not be able to negotiate it. What this treaty does is clearly lay out the rules for negotiation. It protects the interest of Canadians, as the hon. member said. It allows for taxation of first nations. It removes that particular first nation from the Indian Act, which certainly all hon. members would have to agree is a good thing. I do not think that even the Reform members can say it is a bad thing to have the Nisga'a nation no longer under the auspices of the Indian Act.\n\nThe fear I have with misrepresentation is if we try to move the issue over and say, “look what is going on in Nova Scotia”. What is going on in Nova Scotia is because there is no treaty, an aboriginal title has not been settled. We are depending on something that went on in 1760 that is a page and a half long and that is open to very wide interpretation. Let us settle these issues. Let us negotiate real self-government for first nations in Canada. Let us understand that all first nations want to be real partners in the Canadian federation. Let us open that door and allow them in. Unlike the Victoria legislature, let us open the door and invite them in.",

The other party members all have a well worn spot between their shoulder blades where they have been patting themselves on the back.\n\nThe hon. member discounts out of hand the expert advice we received. He is a member of the committee and he sat there and listened to the advice from the likes of Professor Stephen Scott, a professor of the law faculty at McGill University; Mel Smith, former constitutional adviser to no less than three premiers in British Columbia; Gordon Gibson, the former leader of the Liberal Party in British Columbia; Gordon Campbell, the current leader of the official opposition, the Liberal Party of British Columbia; and Professor Tom Flanagan from the University of Alberta. They are recognized experts in their fields who have said that this is indeed a violation of Canada's constitution. It is the subject of two lawsuits in British Columbia brought by the B.C. opposition Liberal Party and by the Fishery Survival Coalition. The member stands up and completely discounts this out of hand.\n\nAlong with the remarks that he has made about the Reform Party and the aspersions he has cast on us, is he casting aspersions on these people as well? Does he put them all in the same boat as the Reform Party? Is he suggesting that these constitutional legal experts are deliberately attempting to mislead Canadians by fabricating myths?",

One is the unfortunate policies of the provincial NDP government. The other is the fact that aboriginal title in so many parts of the province is uncertain. This treaty is a major step in the right direction in dealing with that second uncertainty. I strongly welcome it on behalf of all those who are interested in B.C.'s economic future.\n\nThe opportunity to speak is fast evaporating. However, I would like to suggest that it has been known since the very beginning by non-Nisga'a that this was an injustice done to the Nisga'a people. Let me refer to my own family history.\n\nMy grandfather, born in 1880, was a small boy at the time of the 1887 arrival in Victoria of the Tsimsean and the Nisga'a people who came to plead for the land. Later, when I was much his age, he told me based on his experiences and his time in northern British Columbia of that injustice. At that time, when I was a small boy, he persuaded me—an easy job—that in fact there was an injustice to right. I must say how proud I am after all this time that I am here in the House with the privilege of being the last speaker in this debate as the senior minister for British Columbia, pointing out that we will now right that injustice done all those years ago.\n\nMany things have been said about this treaty in the heat of debate which hon. members of the official opposition will not only regret but will be deeply ashamed of in the years to come. They know that if we do not settle this treaty now, which has been discussed, debated and argued in meeting after meeting throughout the province, in the legislature of British Columbia in its longest ever debate, in this House for hour after hour, then it is a case of going directly to the courts.\n\nThere is no opportunity for starting the negotiations again. They hold that out as a hope that somehow negotiations will take place and will result in the Nisga'a giving up some of the things they have negotiated for and fairly won in this treaty process.\n\nIf we do not wish to go back to court and have these matters determined by the courts alone but to have them determined instead by fair discussion, debate and honest analysis of one another's positions, as has taken place, then we had better approve this treaty. That is the crux of the Nisga'a treaty that is before us today.\n\nThe treaty is fair and practical. It will contribute to peace and prosperity in British Columbia. It will facilitate long awaited reconciliation that has been sought for over a century.\n\nAs the justices in the Delgamuukw decision said, we are all here to stay so we—",

He is concerned that the supplementary estimates under consideration today authorize expenditure for the next fiscal year, namely 2000-01.\n\nAs I indicated in my ruling on this point on June 8, 1999, at page 16065 of Hansard , the “fiscal year” runs from April to March and a “yearly appropriation” bill must be based on the estimates for the fiscal year to which it relates and must be adopted by parliament to cover the government's expenses for that fiscal year.\n\nI thank the hon. member for bringing up the point earlier in the day so it would give me a chance to look it over. I have looked carefully at the supply bill which is now before the House and I am satisfied that indeed it is based on the supplementary estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000. As in the previous appropriation bill, this appropriation bill provides the same short title “Appropriation Act No. 3, 1999-2000”.\n\nThe so-called multi-year appropriation authority provided in schedule 2 of the bill is based on legislation approved by parliament in 1998, by which the Parks Canada Agency and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency are granted authority to carry over to the end of the 2000-01 fiscal year any unexpended balance of money remaining at the end of the fiscal year 1999-2000.\n\nAs was the case last June so also it is the case now. This money is being appropriated for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. It might all be spent in this fiscal year and, if so, it must be authorized by an appropriation for this year. We are talking here about a yearly appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1999-2000.\n\nThe hon. member refers to subclause 6(2) of the supply bill now before the House and compares it against the language of carryover that I used last June with reference to the enabling legislation relating to Parks Canada. In my view subclause 6(2) serves the same purpose as did subclause 6(2) in Bill C-86 on June 8, 1999, namely, to reflect the authorization provided in the enabling legislation and a process whereby multi-year spending is to be applied to the applicable appropriations act in sequence.\n\nAccordingly what is included in schedule 2 is already authorized by parliament and is referred to in clause 2 for information purposes only. My ruling is therefore that the supply bill is properly before the House.\n\nI would like to thank the honourable member for his interest in the business of supply. I encourage him to keep on being vigilant and I thank him.",

I would like to address the motion that was passed by the House on December 7, which in the result would apply a series of votes, some 120 votes, with regard to supplementary estimates. I submit that would in effect breach the privileges of independent members of parliament.\n\nThe House leaders of the various political parties came together and decided that with regard to their respective political parties the votes could be applied. This motion presumes to anticipate how independent members of parliament would vote on each and every motion before the House.\n\nFor that reason I submit that it breaches the privileges, because how could the House know in advance how I would vote on the 120 motions before the House?\n\nIf I might conclude, technically it would be my submission that unanimous consent would be required in order to avoid a roll call vote on each of the votes, and if it is the will of the House in effect to apply votes then again unanimous consent would be required.\n\nHowever, having said that, and in the spirit of Christmas, I am prepared to give my unanimous consent so that all votes can be applied.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, for over two and a half years my party and I have been arguing with the Government of Canada that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is one of the most out of control departments in the entire country. Here are a few examples of where that department is completely out of control.\n\nRecently the amalgamation of the coast guard resulted in one of the coast guard vessels going into Saint John harbour to hold a gala party for correctional officers. Also, since 1988 $4.2 billion has been spent restructuring the east coast fishery to no avail.\n\nWhen the Marshall decision came down, it was quite obvious that DFO did not have a plan. We said from the beginning when the decision came down that DFO and the Government of Canada should have been prepared. Now we know from internal documents acquired through access to information by reporter Kevin Carmichael that the government had a plan but it did not want to present it to anyone because it did not want to affect, fear or shame anyone in its decision.\n\nIt is quite obvious that the government abrogated its responsibility and abrogated its duty to the people of Canada and the aboriginal people of Atlantic Canada.\n\nThe current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has constantly stated in the House that it is better to negotiate than it is to litigate. After the Sparrow decision, the Delgamuukw decision and now the Marshall decision, it seems the only recourse that aboriginal people have is constantly to go to the courts to meet their end means.\n\nIf the government truly believed in the fact that it is better to negotiate than to litigate, then I tell the government right now that it had better deal with the issue of non-status aboriginal people when it comes to status aboriginal people, especially in my home province of Nova Scotia. The non-status aboriginals believe quite firmly that the Marshall decision applies to them. There is legal opinion that says it may very well apply to them as well.\n\nAs well, the government is focusing on just the inshore aspects of the Marshall decision. We put it quite clearly to the government, and we wish it would stand up in the House and speak to the fact that the Marshall decision should apply to the inshore, the midshore and the offshore sectors. It should not be just one sector of the fishing community that bears the brunt of the decision. It should be a more co-operative approach toward all the fishing regimes so that the aboriginal people can feel like full partners in this industry with fisheries and oceans.\n\nIt was no surprise when the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans left the department fairly quickly. I have said it before and I will say it again that if DFO was on the stock exchange, one could almost accuse the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans of insider trading because he seemed to leave in such a hurry. We know very well that the former minister, who is now the Minister of the Environment, was fully aware of how the Marshall decision may have come about for the people of Nova Scotia and especially the aboriginal communities of Atlantic Canada.\n\nBecause the government was not showing leadership or foresight in the decision making process, there were incidents in West Nova. There were incidents down in Miramichi at Burnt Church. People threatened one another. Boats were burned. It was a really ugly scene in the maritime provinces.\n\nIt all could have been avoided had the government only shown some leadership. We have asked time and time again for the government, especially the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, to show leadership when it comes to fishing concerns in Atlantic Canada, especially when it comes to the integration of aboriginal and non-aboriginal people and a common property resource.\n\nWe have many ideas on this side of the House on how it should go. We only wish that the government would listen to what we are saying so that all people in Atlantic Canada could share in a common property resource.",

He also has extensive experience in holding consultations with diverse groups throughout Atlantic Canada and so is familiar with the issues these stakeholders are faced with.\n\nMr. Thériault has been involved with the Atlantic commercial fishery in a variety of capacities for the past 25 years. He has been a spokesperson, an adviser and a consultant in a variety of fora related to fisheries issues.\n\nIt is for these reasons that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans determined that they could provide a very important function in negotiating arrangements for the next fishing season that will accommodate the Marshall decision while taking into account the concerns and issues of the existing commercial fishing sector.\n\nMr. MacKenzie and Mr. Thériault are now engaged in the process of discussing with aboriginal leaders—",
