It dates back 30 years, as has been pointed out by numerous members from all parties. It was also important to amend the legislation to reflect a number of court decisions relating to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Action was therefore required, and action there was. Collective action, moreover.\n\nLast fall, my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, pointed out, and rightly so, that this bill is not solely the creation of the government, but is indeed the fruit of a concerted effort by all parties represented in this House, the outcome of which is reflected in the report by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs released in June 1998.\n\nIt is also appropriate to point out, I believe, that this reform of our electoral process has its roots in the Lortie commission of 1991. In other words, our future elections act has taken close to nine years in gestation, parliament after parliament, committee after committee, study after study, consultation after consultation. A nine year gestation period.",

            "text": "Yes, in fact, it is like four elephants in a row.\n\nI will not dwell at length on the many stages we went through before undertaking this reform, because these are well known. However, I will mention the reports, three of them, from the chief electoral officer, which have guided our efforts and, of course, as I said, the work done by the former and current members of the committee.\n\nLast fall, I took advantage of the parliamentary break to travel across the country to meet academics and students, and to talk to them about the reform that was taking shape.\n\nWhat changes will be made by the bill? First, there a number of changes of an administrative nature. For example, the problem of voting hours in time zones that do not switch to daylight savings time has been corrected. We have also given returning officers the right to vote, which is certainly something that was due.\n\nWe are ensuring that the right of candidates to campaign in multiple unit residential buildings is protected by law so that people who own these large buildings cannot stop a candidate from entering if they happen to favour another political party.\n\nWe have also harmonized certain measures of the act which the requirements of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have called for in various judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada, mainly the Libman decision. This includes the reintroduction of third party spending limits. I will come back to that point in a few minutes.\n\nFinally, with regard to financing, we have attempted to make certain provisions of the act consistent with the economic reality of today; that is to say, to take into account the need to change some of the measures which were designed some 30 years ago.\n\nSince Bill C-2 was introduced there have been some important changes. The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs continued its important work throughout the fall. I know something about this because I was called upon to testify before the committee on at least three different occasions. The latest conclusions of the committee are reflected in Bill C-2. The committee made a number of amendments to the bill which I would like to outline to the House today.\n\nHon. members will recall that originally the Canada Elections Act included a blackout of some 72 hours before polling day. The supreme court felt that 72 hours was too long, but that a blackout was justifiable. The court felt that 72 hours was not justifiable and that in order for this blackout period to work there would have to be other elements to justify it.\n\nWe initially wanted a blackout period of 48 hours. Many people, including members of the House, told us they would not want to support that measure. Therefore, we eliminated the provision entirely, except for a blackout on voting day. That came largely as a result of representations which we received from western Canadians who felt that it was inappropriate to have the results in central Canada known to people in western Canada before they had voted themselves, something which we recognized some time ago. It was equally important to protect the new so-called exit polls from the night of the election from becoming known until people had actually voted themselves. We concur with that and the change has been made to reflect it.\n\nWe also have a blackout that establishes a cutoff for polls and ads to ensure that voters across the country have access to the same information before they vote.\n\nIf we think it is important for voters in western Canada not to have access to the results of the votes cast in eastern Canada, surely it is equally important for voting held previously and as manifested in exit polls not to be revealed before the voting is complete.\n\nWe had also decided to abolish the process of vouching, which allows voters in rural regions to guarantee the identity of their neighbours at the polling place, even if those neighbours have not been registered. Here, as well, we heard some concerns and we have agreed to extend this vouching process to all electoral districts subject to certain conditions. I want to thank the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre who made excellent contributions to the committee in this regard, and who offered amendments.\n\nAnother amendment he offered, which we accepted at report stage, would allow us to know the identity of people who give contributions through companies they own when those companies are numbered companies and do not otherwise have easily identifiable names. Now the names of the principals will be known.\n\nI believe the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes also made a contribution to that effect and I thank him as well.",

            "text": "The Minister for International Trade is reminding me that Les Patriotes were great Liberals, and I would not want to forget them.\n\nGetting back to my speech, I do not want to get into partisan rhetoric, because it is not in my nature.\n\nAnother point of concern is the personal safety of electors. If there is reason to believe that the disclosure of electors' personal information, such as their address, would put them in danger, they would be allowed to indicate a former place of residence. This is very important for women who live in shelters for battered women. Their aggressors would not be able to find them because the address would not be on the voter's list. That was a side effect in the past when we had to print a permanent voter's list. We have made accommodation in the bill to protect those in danger of violence. This clause will now protect women who are living in battered women's shelters.\n\nWe also recognize the difficulties that can be encountered by persons with disabilities who need help to mark their ballots and who cannot get to the poll. An election officer will come to their residence now and assist them to vote in the presence of a witness of their choosing.\n\nOn the practical side of things, we have considered the future impact of new technologies in the polling process and, more specifically, their utilization. We will authorize the Chief Electoral Officer to develop an electronic voting process and put the process to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to seek approval to test it.\n\nI must thank the hon. member for North Vancouver who has been quite insistent on involving electronics and modernizing the electronic voting process. At his strong insistence, we put that item in the bill.\n\nWith regard to finances, there are a number of changes to the reporting procedures. It should be clear that from now on candidates can include expenditures for child care and the care of any dependants in their reimbursable expenses. Although this clause has been designed for everybody, I hope it will have a particular attraction to women who might want to be candidates. It is not the be all and end all, but if it at least encourages a larger number of women to be candidates then it will have contributed toward the democratic process.\n\nAnother new measure lowers the veil on trust funds.\n\nAgain, it is the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes who brought this issue to our attention.\n\nThe bill stipulates that the name and address of the original donor for any contribution over $200 made through a trust created to promote the election of a candidate will now have to be clearly identified. I thank the hon. member for bringing that issue to our attention as well.\n\nTo respond to the technical concerns expressed by experts, the spending limits for candidates and political parties will be adjusted using the revised list of electors. We now have a larger than usual number of revisions on the permanent voters list. This meant that a candidate running for public office would often not have the total number of names. Therefore, when they set out campaign spending limits and found out later that there was a revision, they were unable to take into account the multiplier effect of the new people added on the voters list in order to increase the amount they were allowed to spend. This will now be taken in account because we have made that adjustment.\n\nThis is where I am afraid that perhaps some members, in particular my distinguished colleague from Vancouver North, might not agree with me. The most important financial reform of this bill relates to the participation of third parties in an election campaign.\n\nThe elections act formerly imposed limits on third parties and candidates. Those of course had been thrown out by a court in Alberta and had not been appealed. The result of this was that in the last election campaign those who wanted to vote for a member of this House had spending limits in terms of what they could do to promote the candidate. However, anyone organizing to defeat a member of this House, effectively had no limit if they organized through a third party.\n\nCall that third party the National Citizens' Coalition, call it the rifle group, call it anything else, it does not matter. Those who were outside of the candidate process could do virtually anything, could obtain funds entirely, if they wished, from outside of Canada, something that is illegal for the purpose of electing someone and they could participate indirectly in the electoral process that way.\n\nLuckily the Libman decision in 1997 by the Supreme Court of Canada declared that control on third party spending would help to preserve the fairness of the democratic electoral process. Bill C-2 rectifies this and now puts in measures to control third party spending.\n\nThe measures concerning third parties are based on three major principles. First, third parties have a right to participate in the electoral process. This is in compliance with the supreme court ruling in the Libman case.\n\nSecond, their spending should be restricted just like that of registered parties and candidates. That is perfectly normal.\n\nThird, even if the third parties have important things to say, their spending should be subject to limits that are stricter than those of the candidates or the political parties, since, after all, still according to the Libman decision, according to the supreme court, the candidates and the political parties are the ones trying to get elected.\n\nSecond, naturally, the limits that apply to the third parties apply only to spending on advertising, whereas in the case of the candidates, the limits apply to almost all spending, including the cost of running an office, election headquarters, and so on.\n\nWe therefore are proposing to limit the advertising expenditures of third parties to $150,000 nationally and to $3,000 within each riding.\n\nWe are also proposing that third parties be required to register once their spending on advertising exceeds $500. We want to avoid in this is having a group with a very small base, such as a school program wanting to write to a candidate, subject to such a limit. We do want to be reasonable. Therefore, only spending of $500 or more would be subject to the elections act.\n\nMembers will agree that all these measures reinforce the three broad principles governing our electoral process, namely accessibility—it is expanded by this process—fairness—I think that, once again, with the measures on the third parties, and so on, the bill talks a lot about fairness—and transparency, which will be increased by the new ways of disclosing amounts and electoral spending.\n\nBill C-2 provides us with yet another opportunity to assert Canada's leadership in the electoral process and thus enlighten democracies the world over.\n\nI am sure that all members will recognize the wisdom of the measures proposed and that they will take this opportunity to support them. Our electoral system is the envy of the world.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will preface my comments today by pointing out that the government has moved time allocation on this bill. It is the 23rd time in this parliament that it has moved time allocation on a bill before the House. It has preliminarily closed debate on bills 23 times since the start of this parliament.\n\nBill C-2 is an example of a flawed bill that the Liberals want to ram through the House. They do not particularly want it to be examined in this public place so they have limited the time for debate. I can see the minister burying his head in shame. I want to remind him that since we began debating the bill in the House, the Reform Party has had only two hours and forty minutes out of a total of seven hours and twenty-three minutes to debate a bill which the minister himself has said, has not been dealt with for 30 years.\n\nBefore making my own comments, I will deal with a few things that were said by the minister. He said that we had improved the Canada Elections Act by combining the results of all the parties working together in the House. However, a few days ago we voted on the report stage amendments to Bill C-2 and there were close to 80 amendments proposed by the opposition. I think this shows the minister that the opposition was far from satisfied with the process to that point. If close to 80 amendments were being proposed at report stage, then the minister must be wrong when he says that the elections act has been improved.\n\nHe also mentioned that he had travelled during the break last fall to talk with academics and students across the country. The funny thing is, the minister would not allow the committee to travel across the country to talk with academics, students and interested parties even though we had made requests to do so. I actually heard him on the radio talk show CKNW in Vancouver. I remind the minister that the callers absolutely trashed the gag law component in Bill C-2 and he had a fairly rough ride from the callers on CKNW in Vancouver.\n\nHe also mentioned the Libman decision. I will come back to that in a little more detail because it does deserve some detailed comment, in particular because of a court ruling that came out of British Columbia on February 9. The minister knows that he is clutching at straws when he quotes Libman. He also knows that it will cost taxpayers a lot of money to defend this flawed bill. What he should have done was had discussions with third party interests and tried to reach some accommodation.\n\nThe minister also talked about the release of results and how things had been done in the bill to make sure that westerners did not see the results of the election before their polls had closed. Even the Chief Electoral Officer told the minister that with the Internet in place now it was almost impossible to prevent the transmission of results. If people want to see them they can dial up the website for Scarborough—Rouge River, for example, where they may have already posted their own local results after the polls close in Ontario. There is really no effective way of preventing the distribution of results.\n\nThe publication of polls is another area that has just come under court challenge in British Columbia. A very important result came out of the province on February 9 which put into question the entire section of the bill to do with publication of polls. I will deal with that a little later as well. I will come back to third party spending limits too because they are an important part of the bill.\n\nAs the minister wrapped up his speech he mentioned our electoral system being admired around the world. That is just plain wrong. The Chief Electoral Officer was questioned at length in committee by members of all parties about the patronage system which is riddled throughout the elections act. The Chief Electoral Officer has no power over who is appointed as a returning officer or a deputy poll clerk. All those positions are patronage appointments put in place by the parties.\n\nWhen the Chief Electoral Officer was asked whether he would recommend our Elections Act to any third world country or an emerging democracy, and I asked him that question, he said he would not. There is no way that he would recommend Canada's Elections Act to a third world country or an emerging democracy. He did not say what the minister just said, that our act is admired around the world. He said the act was not fit for a third world country. I remind the minister that the act is far from perfect.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the minister took great pains to point out the various amendments that were finally accepted by the minister during the committee process, as I mentioned almost 80 amendments were proposed by the opposition parties in the House. We went through a lengthy voting session two nights ago. We were up until 12.40 in the morning voting on almost 80 amendments. That proves absolutely that the opposition parties were not satisfied with what happened at committee.\n\nIt is now crystal clear that the government sent the bill to committee before second reading with the intention of keeping it out of the public spotlight, despite the claims of the minister that the process was designed to accommodate meaningful amendments.\n\nNot very many significant amendments were made in committee, even though the official opposition, third party witnesses, the print media, broadcast witnesses, small parties and many other expert witnesses made suggestions, good ones, on ways in which the bill could have been made more democratic.\n\nThe elections act is so biased toward the parties with seats in the House that it is normal for any changes to the elections act to be slipped through on a Friday afternoon when there is hardly anybody here. I know the people who are watching this debate on television do not have a vista of the House right now, so they cannot see or have any idea who is here and who is not.\n\nI know I am not allowed to mention the presence or not of members in the House, but it is a well known fact that when the government wants things to slip through quietly without too much attention it does it on a Friday afternoon when it can be done with a lot of ease because hardly any members are present.\n\nIn this case I know the minister started off thinking he would be able to push the elections act through in that manner. He was quite surprised to find that initially the official opposition was vigorously opposed to some parts of the bill. That was joined then by the other opposition parties and we turned it into a bit of a nightmare for the minister. He has moved closure on debate now to try to ram it through on a Friday before we all go home for a break.\n\nElections acts should be politically neutral and should be supported by all parties in the House. They should be supported by the Chief Electoral Officer. They should be supported by the voters. That is not the case with the elections act. It is opposed by all those groups.\n\nThe government has wasted an opportunity to modernize and democratize the act. The new act does little more than renumber the paragraphs in the old act. At the same time it tries to reintroduce sections that have already been struck down by the court. The bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of the old act, especially those that benefit the ruling party, which in this case is the Liberal Party.\n\nThe bill does nothing to address serious public concerns involving campaign financing, party registration requirements, the timing of byelections, third party spending issues and patronage appointments within elections canada.\n\nThe rights of electors and third party participants in the democratic process continue to be trampled by provisions which adopt a paternalistic role in terms of dictating how much money can be spent and presuming to decide for electors who is a frivolous candidate and who is not.\n\nIn drafting the bill the government virtually ignored the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, even though the minister made reference to that report. The government also ignored several decisions of various courts and the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe government is very inconsistent in the way it looks at court rulings. Given its past reluctance to go against any court ruling by introducing the bill and pushing it through the House, the government is saying that it is okay for the courts to make child pornography legal and to allocate fisheries according to race, but it is not okay to touch the elections act or anything that affects our ability to get elected, especially if it is the ruling party.\n\nReturning to some specifics of the bill, I will deal first with third party spending. Let us look at the effect of third party spending. I think everybody would agree, if one candidate only has $1,000 to spend—and that is certainly the case with some of the smaller parties—and another candidate like myself has an allowance of $60,000, that there is an imbalance. I think everybody would agree that my $60,000 would allow me to put up billboards and to run advertisements on radio and television. The smaller party candidate who only has $1,000 would be lucky if he or she could put up one or two billboards and would truly be at a disadvantage.\n\nIf we are looking at the difference between $100,000 and $1 million in a riding there will not be much difference. If I could spend $100,000 on billboards and advertisements and somebody else came along with $1 million, he or she would have so many billboards and so many advertisements that it would actually be an irritation that would work against the interest of that third party. Even if there is an influence from third party spending, relatively speaking it is not great when we consider that candidates get to spend $60,000 or more and the parties get to spend a lot more.\n\nThe minister spent a lot of time talking about Libman at which point I mentioned that he was clutching at straws. In Libman v Quebec the supreme court struck down the third party spending limit in the Quebec referendum act as too restrictive. It said that reasonable spending limits were both constitutional and desirable and left it up to the legislatures and parliament to determine a reasonable limit. However the supreme court decision is in conflict with two separate decisions in the court of Alberta and the February 9 decision in the B.C. supreme court which struck down all third party spending limits as unconstitutional.\n\nThe supreme court decision dealt with spending during a referendum campaign whilst the other three courts dealt with spending during election campaigns. It therefore appears that the minister is clutching at straws when he uses the Libman decision based on referendums to try to defend a gag law in an elections act. Furthermore, the main evidence in the Libman case was based on the Lortie report which as the minister stated is some nine or ten years old. The Lortie report was based on a preliminary report by a UBC political science professor named Richard Johnston.\n\nHis report indicated that third party spending—and this was a preliminary report—might influence election outcomes. However, Mr. Johnston filed his final conclusions a few years later in which he said that third party endorsements had no discernible effect on election outcomes. That is the flaw in the Libman case.\n\nIn his ruling in the B.C. case Justice Brenner stated that there was no evidence which would allow him to conclude that third party spending or advertising had any impact on voter intentions and that to override charter rights it was necessary that there be more than a general hypothetical concern about a problem when there was no evidence the problem existed in the past or is likely to exist in the future.\n\nThe Libman case was based on the Lortie report, which was based on flawed evidence. The B.C. court pointed out that flawed evidence. If the minister forces the issue back into court—and certainly the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the National Citizens' Coalition have said they would take it there—he will lose. There is no doubt that referendum spending is different because it only relates to a yes and no answer to a question, whereas elections involve an enormous number of issues and candidates. The same rules cannot be applied, and in any case not a single study in the world indicates that third party spending can be linked conclusively to an election result.\n\nMr. Gerald Chipeur, a constitutional lawyer with the firm of Fraser Milner, has successfully challenged unfair sections in both the provincial and federal elections acts. He told the procedure and House affairs committee that the Libman decision would likely not survive a challenge because of its applicability to referendums rather than to elections.\n\nIn addition, one group that appeared before the procedure and House affairs committee was Environment Voters. In support of its arguments against third party spending limits, it provided an opinion letter from barrister Clayton C. Ruby of Ruby and Edwardh, a law firm in Toronto. In his letter Mr. Ruby stated that in his view third party spending limits could not be justified under the constitution. He also made reference to the Libman decision by stating:\n\n—these limitations were postulated by the Court in the context of a simple yes/no proposition being put to the electorate of one province. Limitations that are appropriate to this kind of narrow and focused question are simply inappropriate to the broad complexities and shaded nuances of a many sided campaign for a general election...I believe these new proposals for a campaign spending limitation are flatly unconstitutional.\n\nThe supreme court passed an opinion on the Alberta court's striking down as unconstitutional spending limits in the elections act. The supreme court put out its opinion that it did not think the Alberta court's ruling was valid in terms of elections even though the supreme court had not studied the evidence. It was not a ruling based on evidence. Yet the minister continues to cite the supreme court's comments as justification for imposing spending limits on third parties.\n\nFar from levelling the playing field, if the supreme court decision were to be upheld it would give advantage to the Liberals because it restricts the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election.\n\nThe new bill limits third party spending to $150,000 for a general election, of which no more than $3,000 may be spent in any particular riding. This is in stark contrast to the total election spending limit for the Liberal Party of Canada which is close to $30 million. Of this amount, approximately $18 million is allocated to its 301 candidates in the form of their individual campaign expenses, while the remaining $11 million can be spent directly by the party.\n\nBy way of comparison, for the 1997 general election the election expenses limit for the Bloc Quebecois was $3.02 million. For the PC Party it was $8.5 million. For the NDP it was $11.4 million and for Reform it was $8.5 million. Let us remember that these were the maximum amounts allowed and not necessarily the actual amounts spent. They are based partly on the number of candidates running.\n\nI already mentioned that the National Citizens' Coalition and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation intend to challenge third party spending limits as unconstitutional. They are confident of winning their case based on what has been learned from the Alberta, the B.C. and the Quebec court decisions.\n\nIt is not the place of the government to limit the right of individual Canadians or groups of Canadians to spend their own money in support of a cause or candidate. The right to spend one's own money on election advertising is a right which is just a valid for the poor as it is for the wealthy. It would have been a much better approach to consult with third party interests across the country in an effort to reach a compromise on reasonable spending limits. That way the expensive cost of court challenges, which will eventually strike down all the limits, could have been avoided.\n\nIn completing this section I would mention as evidence that third party spending cannot be tied directly to any outcome. During the referendum on the Charlottetown accord the yes side lost even though it spent 10 times as much as the no side. During the 1993 election the PC Party spent many millions of dollars more than any other party in the race and yet had only two members elected to the House. Reform, which spent one of the smallest amounts per member, had 54 members elected to the House. In addition, referenda conducted in Switzerland and California over several decades show no correlation between the amount spent by each side and the final voting result.\n\nEven if third party spending did make a difference in elections, why would we be opposing that? Elections are supposed to be for the voters. If the voters are upset or pleased with any candidate, why should they not be permitted to spend their own hard-earned money on opposing or endorsing that candidate as they see fit? What right does the government have to interfere in their freedom to express their opinion about a candidate?\n\nI am prepared as a member of this House to have any third party spend anything it wants in my riding. I believe that as long as members of the House are following the will of their constituents, they will not be removed from office. It is when they choose to represent their party view or their own personal view over the will of their constituents that they get kicked out of office. That is why many members are afraid of third party spending limits. They are afraid that if they do not obey their constituents' will and instead obey their party will or personal will, they will be thrown out of office.\n\nI have one more quote from the ruling of the B.C. Supreme Court on February 9 regarding third party spending. The court said: “There are certain circumstances in which the goal of fairness in elections would support an argument for third party advertising. If in a future election campaign all of the parties were to agree on a significant policy point then the lack of third party advertising would mean that the people would be limited to the views of the major political parties and media commentators. The third party spending limits would effectively silence citizens who wished to express a contrary view”.\n\nThat is an argument right from a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It supports the idea of third party spending limits. I find that an interesting and supportable argument.\n\nTurning to the publication of poll results during the blackout period, in the case of Thomson Newspapers v the Crown, previous legislation preventing the publication of poll results in the final 48 hours of an election campaign was struck down. The government is now imposing a 24 hour blackout even though the print media have declined to give any assurances that they will not again challenge this provision in court.\n\nI would say that the print media probably have been encouraged to take this back to court by the ruling which just came down from the British Columbia court. The British Columbia court has struck down yet again any blackout provisions on the release of poll results and it went every further. It said there should not even be a requirement to print methodology for the polls. What the court in B.C. has said is that there is no right of government to interfere in the publication of polls or even the methodology for those polls.\n\nThe government rejected a suggestion that I made in committee and which was accepted as a compromise by the media, that they could print poll results right up until the time of the election but they would have to print the methodology so that voters would know how those poll results were obtained. The minister rejected that compromise. Now the court is striking down the entire provision that was in the act. We have ended up with something worse than if we had accepted the compromise which I negotiated with the parties during committee.\n\nClause 326 of the new elections act requires that the first person to transmit poll results and anyone who transmits them in the 24 hours thereafter, must provide the details of the poll methodology. However, in the recent Pacific press case in British Columbia, Justice Brenner struck down the provisions requiring publication of such information on the grounds that it offends the principle of freedom of the press which is guaranteed under section 2(b) of the charter of rights.\n\nAs in his ruling on the matter of third party spending, Justice Brenner applied the rule that in order for a law to justifiably override a guarantee under the charter, it must be demonstrated that there is a pressing and substantial need for such legislation. He concluded that there is no history of false or misleading elections opinion surveys being published, that there is no evidence that any individual has encountered any difficulty in obtaining methodological information from the sponsoring media outlet, and very few individuals are interested in obtaining such information beyond the customary information routinely provided by the media.\n\nJustice Brenner therefore concluded there is no pressing and substantial need for these requirements and he struck down the law. We now have the British Columbia case of February 9 pushing another section of the minister's elections act right out the window.\n\nPublic opinion begins to form long before the election writs are issued. It continues to be shaped throughout the election period and after based on the many types of information and issues that are being discussed. To suggest that voters will change their allegiance on the basis of poll results a few minutes before they go to the polls is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIn committee the Chief Electoral Officer of Ontario had this to say about blackout provisions: “I have concluded that the blackout has no truly useful purpose and therefore ought not to be imposed on the electorate for electoral process. It is unnecessary and it limits the constitutional right otherwise given to Canadians. I suggest that Bill C-2 not impose blackouts at all”. He also stated that enforcement of blackout provisions is virtually impossible.\n\nConstitutional lawyer Gerry Chipeur, whom I mentioned earlier, in his presentation to the committee said that of all of the provisions in this bill that fly in the face of court decisions, the blackout provision is the most certain to be struck down.\n\nTurning to another court case on the requirements for registered party status, in March 1999 an Ontario court struck down the sections of the elections act which would require a party to run 50 candidates in an election to remain on the register and to have its candidates listed with party affiliation on the ballot. The court indicated that two candidates should be sufficient to constitute a party. However all of the small parties who appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, including the Communist Party of Canada which had challenged the law and had it struck down, said that the number 12 as contained in a private member's bill which I had put forward to the House was an acceptable compromise.\n\nAll members will know that the number 12 relates to the recognition of party status in this House. The position I put forward in committee was that 12 was a sensible number as opposed to two, which most people would think was a bit low.\n\nIf the government had bothered to consult with the affected parties an acceptable compromise could have been reached because all of the parties agreed to 12. Then we could have finished this whole legal court challenge, put it to bed and we would have had a workable number in the bill. However, the minister refused to accept it and now that case is going to appeal on March 2 and 3, in a couple of weeks. Right about the time that this bill goes to the Senate we are going to have a court case probably striking down provisions in the bill. It is totally ridiculous the way the minister has handled this matter.\n\nThe court said that we could have a party of two people and that is clearly what the court will ultimately decide again. Instead of 12 we are going to end up with two. The minister foolishly has plunged ahead with his number when there is every piece of evidence to support a higher number.\n\nIn fact in committee when he was asked about it, the minister said, “Obviously given that I am the minister who suggested to have the appeal, I am of the opinion that it works just swell the way it is”. I think that shows the intransigence of the minister on this. He is quite happy to ignore the ruling of the Ontario Court of Appeal because he does not like the number 12 or the number two.\n\nThe position the official opposition takes is that elections are for the voters. The government takes the position that elections are for the parties. The reason it wants the 50 candidate rule is because it does not want competition from small parties. The government thought back in 1993 that the Reform Party would not be able to get 50 candidates so we would not be able to have our party name on the ballot. It thought that was a great way to prevent us from ever coming to the House of Commons. It was wrong because here we are.\n\nThe government is still trying to prevent any other party from getting a foothold in this place and it is wrong. Voters have a right to know that if there is a candidate on their ballot, that that candidate has a relationship to some other candidate in another riding by means of party affiliation. It makes sense for openness and the conveyance of information to voters that there be a party name on the ballot beside every candidate who is a member of a party, regardless of whether that party runs 12 candidates or 50 candidates in the election.\n\nTurning to patronage appointments, one of the worst parts of the whole elections act and the piece that the Chief Electoral Officer criticized three times in three separate appearances at committee was the patronage appointments in Elections Canada.\n\nThe Chief Electoral Officer cannot even appoint his own returning officers. All 301 returning officers are appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada. They are Liberal patronage appointments to what should be non-partisan positions throughout Elections Canada. It is a disgrace. No wonder the Chief Electoral Officer will not even recommend our elections legislation to a third world country because of the patronage that is riddled throughout it. He told the committee how difficult it is to get rid of an incompetent returning officer because he cannot go to the Prime Minister and say “Your political appointee is incompetent and an idiot who should be removed from office”.\n\nEvery one of the opposition parties tried to get the government to change that rule and to allow the Chief Electoral Officer to advertise based on competence and ability to do the job.\n\nThat whole system of patronage runs right through Elections Canada with all the political parties being able to appoint people at the lower echelons within the structure. Certainly many of my Reform colleagues and I refused to do that in the last election. We insisted that the returning officers advertise in the newspaper for qualified people. That is the way it should be done.\n\nWe are coming very close to question period. At this stage I would like to put forward an amendment.\n\nI move:\n\nThat the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following therefor:\n\nBill C-2, an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons, repealing other acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts, be not now read a third time, but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for the purposes of:\n\nReconsidering clause 350 in light of the B.C. Supreme Court ruling of February 9, 2000 that struck down gag law provisions in the B.C. Elections Act and prior similar rulings of the Alberta Court of Appeal with due regard for the constitutional right of Canadian citizens to free expression;\n\nReconsidering clause 370 in light of an Ontario court ruling that struck down provisions requiring political parties to endorse a minimum number of candidates in a general election in order for the party to be registered, with due regard for the right of small, regional and nascent political parties not to be disadvantaged such as by having their names excluded from the ballot;\n\nReconsidering clauses 324 to 328 in light of the B.C. Supreme Court ruling of February 9, 2000 that struck down provisions in the B.C. Elections Act imposing a blackout on the publication of poll results and requirements for the publication of methodological information, with due regard for the constitutional right of Canadians to free expression;\n\nReconsidering clause 13 with due regard for the democratic principle that the Chief Electoral Officer should be selected in a non-partisan and democratic fashion rather than being unilaterally and arbitrarily appointed by the government of the day;\n\nReconsidering clause 24 with due regard for the entreaties of the Chief Electoral Officer that he be allowed to hire returning officers according to merit as determined through competitions open to all qualified Canadians, to insulate the appointment process from partisanship;\n\nReconsidering clause 26 with due regard for the principle that the electoral system and all of its agents constitute the very foundation of the democratic process in Canada, and as such the appointment of assistant returning officers should be free of real or perceived political bias;\n\nReconsidering clause 34 with due regard for the importance of insulating the process for appointing deputy returning officers from patronage, nepotism and partisanship;\n\nReconsidering clause 35 with due regard for the principle that poll clerks should be hired impartially on the basis of merit rather than being appointed by the government of the day according to political affiliation;\n\nReconsidering clause 57 with due regard for the danger that the timing of general elections could be manipulated for reasons of political opportunism by the government of the day;\n\nReconsidering clause 59 with due regard for the right of Canadian citizens who are inflicted by natural or man-made disaster to have full and fair opportunity to participate in the electoral process;\n\nReconsidering clause 67 with due regard for the constitutional right of all Canadians, regardless of wealth, to be qualified for membership in this House; and\n\nReconsidering clause 143 with due regard for the potential for abuse of the electoral process such as the casting of multiple ballots by a single voter on behalf of imaginary friends or the registration of household pets as voters.",

In so doing, he is saying no to the Government of Quebec, to the Liberal Party of Quebec, to the social and community organizations of Quebec, and the families of Quebec in particular.\n\nOf course, keeping that program in Ottawa lends political visibility to the Liberal Party.

I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville.\n\nI am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today about this very important issue, especially in light of the announcement that was made as recently as yesterday by the government. I am speaking about the agricultural crisis, especially as it relates to western Canada and producers in all four western provinces. As members will notice, I have included my own province of British Columbia.\n\nNot many people understand that in the northeast corner of British Columbia, an area that I represent, there is an agricultural sector that is very similar to the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is a very important issue in my particular riding of Prince George—Peace River and all across Canada, but especially on the prairies.\n\nIn the brief time that I have I must say that I feel the government has failed miserably in properly and adequately addressing the agricultural income crisis in Canada today. I say today because the most recent opportunity to address this problem in a very real way was as recent as yesterday and the government failed. The Liberals have failed once again. They have come forward with some ad hoc funding but no plan to get that assistance to the producers, especially the farmers who are beginning to prepare for spring seeding. The uncertainty producers are facing is whether they should even put a crop in the ground this spring. This is something the government needs to address in a comprehensive and very real way. It should not be done in some photo-op by the minister saying “Well, we have listened, we have heard the concerns emanating from western Canada and we intend to address this by throwing in another $240 million”.\n\nThis was another announcement just like the others we have seen over the last year and a half.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague from Peace River said, it is the same money. They just keep announcing it over and over again.\n\nFarmers are not fooled. One of the reasons that the official opposition, the Reform Party of Canada, launched its own series of grassroots agricultural meetings across western Canada was to get input from farmers themselves at small townhall meetings, not by blowing into Regina, Saskatoon or Calgary and talking to a select group of witnesses who appear before the standing committee. We wanted to go out and talk directly to the producers who were most affected by the government's lack of agricultural policy.\n\nMy colleagues, who are agricultural critics for the official opposition, instituted a plan to travel across western Canada and set up meetings called assistance for struggling agricultural producers, ASAP. The acronym could also be “as soon as possible”. As soon as possible we need to help farmers in Canada. It is important for Canadians to ask themselves a very serious question at this juncture of our history: Do we want to have a viable agricultural industry in Canada? If the answer to that is yes, and I suspect it is, we want a healthy and secure supply of food in our nation, then we must give farmers the support that is necessary and the certainty to conduct their business.\n\nWe have been holding these meetings all across western Canada. By the time they are done, around mid-March, my colleagues will have conducted over 60 small townhall meetings scattered across western Canada. In my riding we held one about half way through the north and south Peace River agricultural regions in a small little community called Farmington. I suspect this is one of the few times members will hear that name in this place. It is not a big community but it is a very important agricultural community in my riding of Prince George—Peace River.\n\nThe meeting was held on January 11, a cold winter night with blowing snow and blizzard conditions in the Peace River country in northern British Columbia. We expected maybe a few dozen farmers to show up. When my colleague and I went to the meeting we were not sure just how many people would brave the cold, the wind and the snow that night but over 100 farmers came out to that meeting, these were men and women who realized their livelihoods and the very security and future of their family farms were at stake. Some of them travelled dozens of kilometres and, in some cases well over 100 kilometres, to attend the meeting that night.\n\nMy colleague from Peace River held similar meetings in his riding of Peace River, Alberta, the adjoining riding just immediately to the east of my riding. He held meetings in Grande Prairie and Peace River and the response was the same. If we lump the two meetings together, we had well over 150 individuals show up to air their concerns.\n\nFollowing the meeting we had in Farmington, one of my constituents undertook a unique journey. Nick Parsons, from Farmington, a small community just north of the city of Dawson Creek, at mile zero of the Alaska highway, took it upon himself to undertake a combine odyssey to Ottawa. He decided to drive his combine right here to Parliament Hill.",

I know this because I have driven it, but I was not driving a combine. It took me about four days by car as compared to his four to six weeks to drive his combine down here.\n\nMembers would be amazed at the support this farmer has received during his travels. When I was talking to him via his cell phone the other day he told me that his journey is one of tears and fears. The fears of Canadian farm families are being expressed to him as he travels across western Canada; the fears that the industry is dying and the fears that there is no hope.\n\nCan anyone imagine being a farmer in western Canada today? The reality is that the government has given them no hope for a future. This is being expressed to Nick Parsons every day as he continues his journey across western Canada. Every day individuals stop Nick's combine and hand him $20, $10 or whatever they can afford to assist him in his journey across western Canada while he tries to draw attention to the plight of the farm family and farms in Canada. He wants everyone to know that no matter how hard the farmers have struggled, they cannot make ends meet. No matter how efficient they have become over the last number of decades, the reality is that they cannot make ends meet because international subsidies have driven down the price of their product to the point where they cannot pay their bills. They are now on the verge of losing their farms and their homes.\n\nI have to try to convey the tragedy that is occurring on farms across western Canada to the urban public who perhaps might be watching the proceedings today. What is happening is a national tragedy.\n\nFarmers are looking to the government for something more than having money thrown at them, money that never reaches them. In the last year or so I have often made the comment that no matter how many announcements, how many photo opportunities the government has to announce the same money over and over again, all the money in the world sitting on the cabinet table does the farmer and his family absolutely no good until it is on their kitchen table.\n\nOf the money that was announced, even before the most recent announcement yesterday, around 25% has actually reached farmers to help them. This is a tragedy.\n\nIt is unfortunate that my time is up because I could, on behalf of farmers all across Canada, go on speaking about this all day.",

I note there was an earlier report in December 1998. These two reports indicate that there is a problem. Members of the agriculture committee understand there is a problem and they want to do something about it.\n\nAfter reading the report, I agree with much of the analysis and much of the analysis has been provided by the member who just spoke.\n\nThe New Democratic Party caucus disagrees strenuously with at least one conclusion in the report. Our agriculture critic, the member for Palliser, tabled a minority report, an addendum to the report, in which he stated that the committee suggests that Canada is so impoverished that it cannot afford to invest in our grain farmers to the same extent as other countries.\n\nThe report indicates that Canada cannot compete with the treasuries of these countries. My hon. colleague, the member for Palliser, says that Canada certainly has the financial resources to compete on a comparative basis with the United States and Europe. The problem is that the Canadian government has decided it does not want to compete. We know that it has cut support to farmers since 1993 by roughly 60%, so my colleague in this minority report is saying that we in fact can compete.\n\nWe have been on to this issues, as has the Reform Party. The NDP caucus has and will continue to support farmers in rural communities in the ways that they are attempting to put bread on their own tables in addition to putting it on ours.",

What I was trying to drive home during my brief remarks is that I think it is incumbent upon all Canadians to look inside themselves at this juncture in our history to decide what priority they place on our agriculture industry.\n\nThe hon. member was referring to the level of support that other countries give to their agricultural sector, whereas in Canada, especially in the grain sector, we have seen a diminishing level of support from the federal government over a number of years. We could debate all day how much our national treasury can afford to support an individual sector of the economy.\n\nThe member referred to his party's minority report on the report of the standing committee. Our agricultural critics also put forward a minority report in which we listed eight positive things, other than just an ad hoc propping up of the sector, the government could undertake to assist farmers.\n\nThe farm safety net programs must be reformed to ensure long term stable protection. That was one of the things that we put forward, something that a lot of farmers have advocated for a long time. A lot of farmers have been involved through their local producer organizations in promoting an expanded NISA program, the Net Income Stabilization Act.\n\nThe federal government could lower the costs it imposes on producers by giving general tax reductions, lowering user fees charged by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food and reducing federal taxes charged on the manufacture, transportation and sale of agricultural input such as fertilizer and especially fuel.\n\nWe hear members raising the issue of the high cost of fuel in the House every day. That is something the government could move on. It could do something about that. It could bring down the taxes on fuel. It would have a direct impact on the input costs of farmers as they do their planning for this spring's seeding.\n\nAs well the government could further lower the costs of farmers by enabling a competitive, commercially accountable grain handling and transportation system. Many parliamentarians from all parties have talked about changes to our transportation and grain handling system, yet very little is being done.\n\nThe official opposition, the Reform Party of Canada, has identified a whole raft of things in our minority report, as have other parties, that the government could be doing to assist farmers. Yet we see nothing but a photo op and government members saying they will throw another couple of hundred million dollars at it. Maybe it will eventually get to the farmers and maybe it will not, but they will throw it at them in the hope that it solves the problem. Farmers especially know darn well it will not solve the problem.",

The point I am trying to make is that the more we can get people from the other side joining together with us to show this is a non-partisan issue and to communicate to the people in the cities the plight of farmers, the better off we will all be.\n\nThere are some real issues we have to deal with in this place and it is very difficult sometimes not to be partisan. It is great to see members on the other side helping us because they do not have elected people on the prairies and in rural ridings to help communicate that message to the cities. There is one cabinet minister from Regina who is strangely silent on the issue, but I am glad to see other members trying to do their best.\n\nAs I mentioned, I have been travelling with the committee. Yesterday the Prime Minister made quite a big deal of the fact that $1 billion were being made available to farmers in Saskatchewan. I need to clarify the fact that it was not $1 billion in new money. I hope he does not think farmers are not smart enough to know what has been going on.\n\nWe have used the words billion dollar boondoggle in referring to the mismanagement of the jobs fund under HRD. I used the words billion dollar boondoggle to describe the gun registry because in a few years a billion dollars will have been wasted going after the good guys rather than dealing with the real problem in Canada in that regard. We could talk about the billion dollar boondoggle in aboriginal affairs, and I suppose there are other areas. Here we have a billion dollar boondoggle. When we look at all the things that are going on, we are going to be talking real money soon. Why do I call it a boondoggle? It is because the money is not getting to farmers.\n\nThe programs are announced. When we listen to the media it sounds like some grand thing has been done. I suppose the impression created in Toronto is that farmers are getting this money. If we listen carefully and we read the fine print, it says that we will know by the end of March how the funds will be disbursed. The farmers need the money. As my colleague from Prince George—Peace River said, it has to be on the kitchen table.\n\nTwo years ago Reform said something needed to be done about the crisis developing in agriculture. The Prime Minister said “These things take time to develop”. What have the bureaucracy and the government being doing for the last two years? The Prime Minister went on to say “You know me. I have to do my homework first”. What was announced yesterday clearly shows that he has not done his homework.\n\nThis is only a small fraction of what farmers pay in tax. Farmers are taxed to the max. Some of their input costs may be as much as 50% tax. People in the cities do not realize that farmers only get back a small fraction of the money they send to Ottawa back.\n\nYesterday I had with me a box of shirts from the backs of a few farmers. They want me to make the point with the people here and across Canada that the government has literally taken the shirts off their backs. I wanted to present those shirts to the Prime Minister and the finance minister on behalf of farmers in Saskatchewan, and they would not accept them. Then I went to the agricultural minister who said he would not take them to the Prime Minister. I still have the shirts that the government has taken right off the backs of farmers.\n\nMany points need to be made in this regard. Reform has suggested a lot of good things. I want to let people who are watching know that they can access a minority report on the Reform's position on the Internet. We are limited in time in the House so I cannot go into all the details, but I will briefly summarize what Reform is saying. Canada must aggressively attack international subsidies and trade barriers so that farmers do not have to compete with all the grain being dumped on the international marketplace that forces farmers to sell their product below the cost of production.",

            "text": "Exactly. My colleague from Peace River has just made the point that we have tended to be the Boy Scouts at the bargaining table. It is about time we got tough. Our competitors are tough.\n\nWhat does that do for prices within Canada? Because farmers are caught in the international marketplace they are actually subsidizing the food being eaten in Toronto. People do not know that farmers are being forced to sell below the cost of production and people within Canada are benefiting from that fact. Whatever happens in the international marketplace happens here. That is why our government has to come to the rescue in the short term and reduce taxes.\n\nThe government must immediately reduce the burden it places on farmers. Farmers pay an inordinate amount of tax, everything from an excise tax on fuel to user fees. What are user fees? For people watching in the cities, user fees such as grain inspection fees amount to $138 million annually for prairie farmers. Farmers are compelled to pay the cost of agencies that benefit all sectors of society. A good quality safe food supply helps everybody but the farmer has to pay the whole shot. That is not fair. Those fees should be reduced, and Reform is asking for that to take place.\n\nThe government should give grain farmers the freedom to market their own grain independent of the wheat board. One may often hear or be given the impression, especially by the minister responsible for the wheat board, that because the wheat board has a monopoly and farmers are not allowed to sell outside it is somehow great for farmers.\n\nThe point is that farmers are not even allowed to process their durum wheat into pasta and put it on the store shelf for sale. The wheat board makes them sell their own grain to the wheat board and buy it back before they can process it. Of course there is a big handling fee and they have to buy it back at a higher price and the profit is diminished.\n\nI hope at some future point I will be able to address this problem even more. We need to debate agriculture a lot more in the House. At this point I would like to move:\n\nThat this House now adjourn and consider these things.",

Frankly a solution that may work in one region will certainly not address issues in other regions. Geographically Atlantic Canadian agriculture faces very different issues from those of western Canadian agriculture. That is common sense.\n\nThe Liberal government changed the EI rules in 1995. It had an extremely deleterious impact on agriculture in Atlantic Canada to the extent that Atlantic Canada farmers in my riding last year lost about 30% of their crops because of the difficulty in attracting seasonal workers.\n\nWith the short growing season in Atlantic Canada, seasonal work issues are more important than they are in other regions. It is a growing season issue. The government may have thought that if the rules were changed those people would go from seasonal work to full time work. It did not work that way. Many of those seasonal workers are now on provincial welfare rolls because of this misdirected policy.\n\nThe Reform Party is positing some solutions for agriculture in western Canada. As a party that purports to be a national party, I would be interested in its recommendations for the seasonal work issue facing farmers in Atlantic Canada.",

Perhaps a point that could be made here is that some of the members of parliament from that area should be representing those people so I would not have to be going there.\n\nIn order to develop our policy we spent time on the farms in that area. It is interesting to note that the farmers there have concerns that are very similar to the concerns in the west. One is that the federal government does not have an agricultural policy which deals with concerns right across Canada. It is time we developed a comprehensive agricultural policy.\n\nThe member says that some of the problems faced by people in his riding are not the same as those in the west. Of course there are individual characteristics but there are common characteristics. One of the things I am finding that farmers and also small businesses face right across the country is that people bear a huge tax burden which they can do nothing about it.\n\nBuilt right into the farmers' input cost, be they on the prairies or in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, is a high level of tax that farmers cannot avoid when the federal government uses employment insurance premiums as a cash cow that is built right into the product. They are pyramided. Whenever the farmer has to buy something he is caught paying that tax and he cannot pass it on. That is just one example.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill deals with accountability for native people. Accountability is something that everybody claims we should have. There are many people on the government side who do their very best to ensure that many do not. Nowhere is the lack of accountability any more blatant than in the case of Canada's aboriginal people.\n\nThe two biggest problems that governments generally have foisted upon native people are the reserve system and the Indian Act.\n\nI had occasion to be present at a service club where a native woman was the speaker for the evening. She was university educated and married to a Vancouver city police officer who was non-native. She was a very articulate woman. She pointed out that under the Indian Act, should she die, she is not even allowed to leave her estate to her husband or her children because the Indian Act makes her a ward of the government, a ward of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.\n\nAnother problem is the reserve system. It is nothing more than the ghettoizing of Canada's native population. In my riding I have the largest concentration of Russian Doukhobor people in the world, bar none. Not even Russia. It was the Doukhobor people's custom to live in a communal lifestyle when they came to Canada. That is the way they established themselves. Over time they have chosen to integrate into society, to have regular jobs, to have homes and to participate in all the benefits and responsibilities of being Canadian. A few have chosen not to do that and have stayed in a communal lifestyle. The operative word is chosen.\n\nThat is something that is being taken away from Canada's native people. There are things being done that virtually force them or at least put a tremendous amount of pressure on them to stay on reserves. The money that goes to the various reserves is done on the basis of the population of the reserve. It is incumbent upon native leaders to find ways to encourage native people to remain on reserve. For people who are not already on reserve they try to force them, in one manner or another, to become residents of the reserve. It is nothing more than a feudal system.\n\nOne of the big problems is elections and how people are democratically elected. When I was talking about the Nisga'a treaty and some of the problems of potential autocratic leadership, some people asked if the leaders were not elected in most cases. The answer is that they are. As I pointed out to them, I am elected. I am the member of parliament for my riding. I am elected by the people of my riding to represent them. If I do not do a good job, they are entitled to write to a newspaper, go on radio, stand on the street corner and rail against me, and run against me in the next election. If they beat me, fine. If they do not, life goes on.\n\nWhat if I owned all their houses, owned their bank accounts and controlled where they worked? What kind of accountability would people have if they became leaders with that incredible kind of power or if someone ran against them and was not successful? When the same people was back into power, what kind or retribution would they force upon the people who had the temerity to run against them and to speak out against them? What is holding those leaders accountable to native people when such things happen?\n\nWe have documented case after case of situations where that has happened. That is not to say that some native bands cannot act benevolently on behalf of their people. We have some excellent cases of that. The Sechelt band operates very effectively with a municipal style native government.\n\nWe have other examples. I mentioned the Nisga'a so I will start with them. Many Nisga'a people live in poverty on reserves, in very oppressive conditions, but there are only 1,700 native people on Nisga'a lands at this point in time. Yet $29 million a year go into their treasury from the provincial and federal governments for 1,700 people. Of course there are individual incomes. How come so many of them are living in such poverty if they have $29 million a year?\n\nIf that is not bad enough, we have the Stoney just across the B.C. border in Alberta. They total 3,300 people and have $50 million a year in income. Yet again many of them live in poverty, some to the point of living in basements of condemned homes. What happens to that money and where is the accountability?\n\nWho speaks on behalf of native people who are looking for help and looking for better living conditions on reserves with the money coming in that is supposed to be theirs in part and supposed to be handled by the leaders on their behalf? Somehow magically it disappears and they are not getting help.\n\nWe have many other examples. The 5,500 Samson Cree have an income of $92 million a year and yet many people on those reserves are living in very trying conditions.\n\nThe government reluctantly agreed under pressure from us to the Nisga'a committee travelling. It made a procedural mistake in the House and had no choice but to agree to it in spite of the fact that it publicly stated it did not want to be there. The government rigged, and I use that word without any hesitation, the witness list to ensure that people who had something to say were not allowed to do so.\n\nWe held an additional day of hearings for people who were frozen out by the Liberal list. We heard from members of the Squamish band who own a great deal of very valuable, very expensive commercial real estate in West Vancouver. They get tremendous royalties and revenues from that as well as the usual provincial and federal government payments. They told us that they received an income of $900 a year from the band in terms of help. We heard cases of people living in rat infested, rusted out trailers. That was the housing provided by the band. There is no accountability, none at all.\n\nWelfare or social assistance is not paid directly to natives who live on reservations. It is paid to the band council. When that money is paid, the government looks upon the council to fairly distribute it to people in need.\n\nOne of the four tribal councils of the Nisga'a is under investigation for welfare fraud. The money that has been going to aid people in need on reservations has in fact not been reaching them. The preliminary investigation indicates that tribal council members' wives and children have been placed on the rolls to receive the money themselves.\n\nWhat are the solutions? One of the first problems we always encounter is getting the government to admit there is a problem. It seems it has at least done that. A letter was written to a constituent by the then parliamentary secretary. I believe he still is the parliamentary secretary. There is much that can be said on the issue, but my time is coming to an end. We think the government should be held accountable. It was acknowledged in the letter which I do not have time to read now that there was a need for accountability. An article in the paper indicated that funding was going to leaders of various special boards to assist people but that it was not getting to them at all.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is indicating that I should be cut off. I can well understand why he would want me to be cut off. The Liberals do not want the truth to get out, but it will get out through newspapers, through us and through native people speaking out.\n\nWhen will the government start listening and start helping people instead of shovelling money at the people who support them? When will it be accountable and start dealing with the real problems of native people instead of trying to buy them off through their leaders?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member in his predictable rather silly, non-factual, inaccurate, exaggerated speech that I have heard 20 to 30 times in the House refers to facts in newspaper articles.\n\nI found it quite intriguing when I read in the National Post that it may have been his riding which received millions of dollars in grants from HRDC. At the same time this fellow is standing in his place very puffed up and self-righteous about how awful it is that we are doing this in Canada. It is quite interesting.\n\nOn a brighter note and more focused on the debate I will address Bill C-222 put forward by the member for Wild Rose for whom I have great respect. He is a decent and good man. He believes very deeply in these issues although he is always wrong. However, we have to be compelled somewhat by his own deep feelings and belief in this regard. That is charming in itself. It is important to the member and we are equally passionate and committed to accountability and the other issues as well.\n\nThe plan we have put forward is about giving aboriginal peoples the tools they need to become self-sufficient, self-supporting, and contributing members of the Canadian family. I think all of us in the House and indeed all Canadians believe our ultimate goal is to have first nations people participate fully in Canadian society.\n\nThe bill would require the federal government to appoint an ombudsman empowered with certain quasi-judicial authority to oversee and investigate operations and elections of first nations, as the member alluded to. The proposed legislation would make it possible for this person, he or she, to propose changes to first nation policies and practices. If a first nation does not make the changes suggested, the ombudsman would make a report to the House of Commons.\n\nIt is not surprising coming from the Reform Party that it hearkens back to the turn of the century when the Government of Canada dispatched officers of the department who were in a sense officers of the court. They had those certain powers to dispatch moneys and work with the native people. They were in fact less bureaucratic and more quasi-police people who policed the reserves. We find it quite unacceptable. Indeed it does not help the situation at all. Not least of which, it does not help first nations people in their communities.\n\nThe bill deals with two main areas relating to accountability: band elections and financial management. I point out some specific problems with the bill. It is incongruent with the Indian Act, I say to the member and his research staff, those great folk in the Reform Party research staff from whom I hear from time to time. These two pieces of legislation could not operate together. The member in constructing the bill missed half the equation.\n\nMembers of the House should note that an election appeals process already exists in the Indian Act under the Indian band election regulations. These election processes, or for that matter any irregularities and complaints, fall within the mandate of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The bill is in direct conflict not only with the act as a whole but with the appeal process generally and more specifically. It is very incongruent. No attempt is made by the member to reconcile the conflict in existing laws.\n\nThe bill also fails to make a distinction between the various ways first nations elect their leaders. There are 610 bands in Canada. Of them 273 conduct their elections pursuant to the electoral provisions of the Indian Act. As already pointed out, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs investigates alleged violations of the Indian Act. These might include ineligible voters, ineligible candidates or secrecy violations. The bill fails to recognize that another 320 of Canada's first nations elect their leadership through traditional practices based on traditional electoral systems.\n\nI do not find that at all surprising. Again, again and again in the House it has been well established and now will be come social fact and a part of Canadian history that the Reform Party does not care about first nations people and has no interest in recognizing their culture, their history and their development as a people in this country, to say nothing of the fact that they were the first people here.\n\nIt does not as well research this project sufficiently to take into account that 17 other first nations have negotiated modern self-government legislation. The legislation governs the manner in which these communities elect their leadership.\n\nOnce this legislation were in place the federal government would have no role to play in the leadership selection process. Given that Bill C-222 would likely infringe on the aboriginal treaty rights or other rights, consultation is required. What would happen if this bill were brought in?\n\nThe auditor general and others have compelled the Government of Canada or the minister not to litigate but to negotiate, in other words to stay out of the courts. It ties up these matters for years and years. It makes for rich lawyers but bad policy, bad outcomes and even more bad situations for first nations people. That has not been thought about at all. The bill does not contemplate that at all. Rather, it takes a confrontational approach once again to a complex problem.\n\nIn short, adopting this bill is not a simple process. I stress that it would require the House to repeal or amend several other pieces of legislation in order to consider passage of this bill. Given that it would likely infringe treaty rights, more consultation and work would obviously have to occur.\n\nMore important, this bill was not developed in consultation with any first nations people, notwithstanding the member's visits. I say quite honestly that on many occasions the member has visited first nations in his communities. He has tried to do something constructive.\n\nOn financial accountability, we need to work closely with first nations communities. The idea of having a policeman of sorts scowling through the books and backyards of first nations communities is not one that is particularly palatable for most reasonable Canadians. Canadians are very fair minded about these issues and would frown quite quickly on the notion of these kinds of practices which are endemic and systemic to the Reform Party. It seems to delight in these kinds of things.\n\nOn the whole question of accountability, two weeks ago in Winnipeg I had the privilege to meet with the Auditor General of Canada, the chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Phil Fontaine, and some 300 first nations people from across the country. We discussed the question of accountability within the first nations communities. I can tell the Reform Party and other members that I was absolutely delighted with that meeting and with discussions with the auditor general. The grand chief and the first nations people were there, many of them women.\n\nThey have a genuine interest in resolving the administrative problems and practices that may be occurring on their reserves. They are not running away from those problems. Many first nations are bringing them forward in their own communities and challenging their leaders to come forward with suggestions to make them more accountable to the members themselves. This is what we cheer on and support. It facilitates government to government relations. It builds a better Canadian society and a better future for first nations people. This is what the government is trying to do.\n\nI ask the Reform Party in bringing forward these kinds of measures not to fan the flames of discontent and irritability which sometimes exist between first nations and other Canadians but look very deeply into these matters. Look at them clearly and soberly. Bring forward to the House of Commons some good suggestions that we might debate and include in our legislation in order to make the country an even better place in which to live.\n\nMr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence and the opportunity to speak in the House and to inform the hon. members. I still am the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, at least, I understand, until July 15.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, to the bill put forward by the hon. member for Wild Rose.\n\nI should say from the outset, if we are to lay our cards on the table right away, that the Bloc Quebecois is going to oppose the hon. member's bill, for various reasons.\n\nWe feel that the bill is extremely paternalistic. I looked up the definition of ombudsman for my personal interest and I would like to share it with everyone. An ombudsman is someone responsible for defending the rights of citizens in their dealings with public authorities. The Reform Party sees an ombudsman as someone who will defend the rights of citizens in their dealings with their own elected representatives. I find this extremely paternalistic, and aboriginal peoples need no more of the paternalism that has always plagued them.\n\nThe Indian Act, which has been in force since 1876, is an extremely paternalistic statute that leaves people completely powerless. Every time they try to escape from the dependence in which they are trapped, they must seek the minister's permission. Whether it is a question of selling grain, buying livestock or trying to expand their band council office, they are always forced to ask for additional funds or seek the minister's permission. This bill is more of the same and, in my view, is very paternalistic. I think that we must trust aboriginals to resolve these issues.\n\nThe government may support them when they have specific needs, but that is a far cry from having the House of Commons establish the office of ombudsman to sort out all these issues. For one thing, I do not believe in it, and for another, I believe it is extremely paternalistic.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois has always been proud to consult aboriginal people before taking a position. I am sure aboriginal people are not interested in having an ombudsman who will interfere in their lives and settle disputes. There are always disputes in society and we cannot always have someone like King Solomon to settle them. Discussion, consultation and mediation are the key to settling any dispute. We do not think that creating the office of ombudsman is the solution to all problems.\n\nThe proposal made by my colleague refers to two problems in particular that he would like to see solved by the ombudsman, namely improper financial administration and electoral irregularities. It is easy to say “we will appoint someone who will settle all this”, but I do not think this is a constructive solution.\n\nAs I was saying earlier, problems are solved through discussion, consultation, mediation and work in the field. It is not up to people in Ottawa to settle these issues once and for all. This is not a way out for first nations, nor is it the way of the future.\n\nThe Reform Party also has a strong tendency to generalize. No one denies that there are problems within aboriginal communities. The auditor general has documented that fact. However, the Reform Party has a tendency to generalize when it discovers short term or very specific problems. Fortunately, the situation is not the same everywhere.\n\nI regularly visit aboriginal communities. They usually are under very good administration. Certainly there are some that are poorly administered, but it is not fair to the aboriginal people to say that this is generalized, that aboriginal people are not good administrators, that they commit election fraud. It is a dangerous trend, one that contributes to narrow-mindedness, to imply that the aboriginal people have always been catered to, hand and foot, and that everything has always been paid for.\n\nI wish to point out that the social contract of the time, and yet they were here first, informed them “We are going to put you into some small areas. There are 600 such small areas throughout Canada, 600 small communities”.\n\nWe told them “We are going to settle you there, and we will pay your bills. Meanwhile, we will take over all the natural resources and everything that you had, because you were the first inhabitants, but now it is all ours”.\n\nGeneralizing in this way, saying that administration is bad on all reserves, is a disservice to aboriginal people, and to the white population as well.\n\nWhat is needed is perspicacity and discernment. That is why we are going to vote against the bill.\n\nAs far as inappropriate financial administration is concerned, I have just said it was not generalized. Things are new. With the agreements on land claims and self-government, more and more money is returning to the native peoples, who are now being invited to administer it.\n\nWe have to put ourselves in the shoes of people who, for 325 years, have administered nothing. The Minister of Indian Affairs has administered everything for them. It is understandable that there are certain problems at times. These people must be given the benefit of the doubt. We must not condemn them out of hand, saying they are worthless, will never manage and will always have to be supervised. Earlier, it was said that the first criticism of this bill was its paternalism. Things have to be seen differently.\n\nThe auditor general has indicated a number of problems, and they have to be resolved other than through an ombudsman. One of the ways proposed, which we wholeheartedly support, involves some support from Canada's chartered accountants. They said they are prepared to lend a hand, to help those communities needing their expertise or to make it available to them at a reasonable price in order to set things up and try to reconcile rigid and responsible administration with the fact that nothing like this has happened for 125 years. This is another way out.\n\nWe also support everything that involves round tables. The native people discuss and settle their problems in a circle. This approach is totally in keeping with native tradition and culture. One way around things would be for the native peoples to meet with specialists in the matter and discuss things until solutions are reached. This should not be left up to someone in Ottawa, who will decide what is right. This is the wrong approach.\n\nAs for electoral irregularities, everyone knows that the Indian Act provides a mechanism. This statute has not always been very sensitive to native traditions. In addition, there have been amendments, with the result that aboriginals may now have their own electoral system, subject to the minister's approval of course. At least now aboriginals can benefit from electoral legislation more in tune with their traditions and culture.\n\nWe would like to see more trust placed in aboriginals. We trust them to sort out their own affairs. When we have bills that affect them, we should consult them. They too have a great desire to end their longstanding dependence on the federal government. When I say end, I do not mean to go their own way completely and do whatever they wish. They must be allowed to manage their future in a manner respecting their traditions and their culture, which are very different from ours.\n\nFor all these reasons, and particularly because we trust aboriginals to resolve their own problems, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose Bill C-222 put forward by the member for Wild Rose.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House to speak to Bill C-222 introduced by the member for Wild Rose. This bill, the first nations ombudsman act, would establish the office of an ombudsman to investigate complaints of an administrative, financial or electoral nature concerning first nations people.\n\nWe have all read in the papers about mismanagement on first nations in Canada and how more than $4 billion provided to first nations in transfer payments did not always reach the intended recipients.\n\nThe problem with this is that it has given some people the false sense that all first nations are poorly managed, when in fact many first nations manage themselves extremely well. It is the examples of mismanagement and misconduct that make the news and malign the efforts of other first nations.\n\nThis does not mean however that an ombudsman's office is not a good idea. On the contrary, this suggestion has a great deal of merit.\n\nThe member for Provencher was stating that he did not think this was a good idea and that he did not believe the government would go along with this because somehow it would mysteriously change the way we do business. Yet our own government has an ombudsman's office and should have an ombudsman's office.\n\nMany organizations, including governments, make use of similar offices to provide people with an avenue by which they can lodge a complaint and feel that their concerns are being addressed.\n\nAs members of parliament, all of us have had occasions where we have either advised constituents of the presence of an ombudsman's office or, as a last resort, when a constituent feels that an ombudsman still has not responded satisfactorily to the problem, we have sent him or her to a higher office. Every member of parliament in the House, I am sure at one time or another, has used an ombudsman's office or has suggested that a constituent use an ombudsman's office.\n\nThe establishment of a similar office for first nations would be an effective and useful means of addressing concerns of aboriginal people, whether it be matters resulting from alleged unfair election practices or financial or administrative problems.\n\nAs the PC Party's critic for Indian Affairs and Northern Development, I had heard from aboriginal people on numerous occasions who have expressed their frustration with the lack of options available to them when they question the procedures or processes of the band chief and council. An independent ombudsman's office would provide a possible solution and would be in a position to assess information and respond to complaints.\n\nFurthermore, it would allow aboriginal people to air their grievances when they feel they have been ignored by the chief and council or are unwilling to discuss it in a more public format. In some cases ombudsman's offices will only investigate an issue if all other avenues have been explored. In the case of first nations, however, it would be more effective if the ombudsman's office could be contacted at any stage or whenever a problem arises. It is my understanding that this bill would not limit access to the ombudsman's office.\n\nIn addition, the bill would allow any member of a first nation community to avail himself or herself of this service whether they live on or off reserve.\n\nUnder the provisions of the bill, the ombudsman would be appointed for a term of five years with the governor in council making the appointment on the recommendation of the minister. First nations would be involved in this process by making representations to the committee that would then report to the minister. It is important to ensure the impartiality of the ombudsman and this process would distance the first nations from the appointment of that ombudsman, otherwise the effectiveness and objectiveness of this office would be jeopardized.\n\nIn places where there have been questions about the legality of election processes or allegations of inappropriate use of band funds, there is currently little opportunity for aboriginal people to lodge a complaint except with the people who are often implicated in that same complaint.\n\nObviously this is not an ideal situation and does little to alleviate the problem. The only other course of action available is to complain to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development or to members of parliament, particularly those in the critic area or with in whose constituency the first nation falls.\n\nThe federal government has a fiduciary responsibility to aboriginal people and has the obligation to work on behalf of aboriginal people to protect their rights. This is an onerous responsibility that is sometimes misunderstood. The bill would acknowledge that first nations people also have to rely upon themselves and their organizations and elected bodies to protect their rights and access to services. Instead of having to outline their complaints to the minister of Indian affairs, they would have an independent ombudsman's office that would address their concerns. With the input of first nations, this process has the potential to help first nations people assume greater responsibility and accountability for their actions.\n\nIn some cases band members are not able to access the information that would help them prove their allegations. The bill would provide an ombudsman with the power and authority to access such records. At the same time, it would be at the discretion of the ombudsman as to what constitutes reasonable grounds for an investigation.\n\nAs I said earlier, I feel the bill has a lot of merit. There are always misunderstandings or misdemeanours that can easily be addressed if the proper process is put in place. The establishment of an ombudsman's office is one solution that could help first nations better serve their communities and, in the long term, provide better service, more transparency and accountability.\n\nThese are objectives that all governments and institutions strive to achieve with varying degrees of success. It is always a good idea to explore new options and possibilities for improvement.\n\nThe bill is a worthy proposal. It is not without some problems but the idea of an ombudsman's office should be embraced by the government and by all members of parliament. It would seem only natural that there be someone to whom ordinary citizens of Canada could turn to when they have questions or when they feel they have not been treated fairly by the authorities. All other segments of Canadian society have an ombudsman's office somewhere that they can turn to. Why should we exclude the ombudsman's office from first nations communities?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, Bill C-222, the first nations ombudsman bill, was proposed by my seatmate and friend, the hon. member for Wild Rose. I would like to thank and congratulate him for this initiative.\n\nI was listening as the parliamentary secretary passed judgment on the bill and I have a couple of comments to make before I start into the main part of my speech.\n\nHe said that the Indian Act is incongruent with this proposal. That may well be, but the minister, I understand, wants the standing committee to look at amendments to the Indian Act and, of course, we can always make amendments to accommodate this proposal.\n\nWhen I travelled with the Indian affairs committee, I spoke to a chief who told me how their traditional electoral practices worked. I will explain this process so that people can hear about the kinds of things that can happen when we go traditional.\n\nWhen all the candidates for a particular office, let us say the chief, get into a large room they are all sent into different corners. While they are waiting there, all the voters gather in the middle of the large room and begin moving toward their various candidates. One can well imagine the intimidation one would feel. This is not to say that anyone is being intimidated, but members can just imagine how lonely we would feel all alone in a corner and then finding out that our jobs had been on the line. There is no secrecy in a situation like that. If someone had found that his or her job or some benefits he or she had accrued as a member of the band were lost as a result of this process, he or she may want to bring that to the attention of an ombudsman.\n\nThe parliamentary secretary said “stay out of the courts”. In response to that, I must say that his government is so frequently in the courts with different bands and first nations that it is almost impossible to write it all down. We know there are hundreds of millions of dollars worth of claims pending against the government.\n\nIf there are flaws, we accept that. There is probably no piece of legislation the Liberals have ever introduced that has been perfect. What do we do when we get a bill? We pass it and send it to a committee for review. We could invite the band leadership to the committee to pass judgment, give their advice on how to improve it or just tell us what they think. Why would we kill it here? The initiative did not come from the House. It came from the grassroots people.\n\nReports of mismanagement are downplayed but they come from across Canada. I was reading newspaper reports last year about east coast chiefs and councillors holding and doling out high paying jobs. Judge Reilly in Alberta caused an uproar when he slammed the Indian leadership for problems that contributed to a number of suicides on the Samson Cree Nation Reserve at Hobbema. Nothing was happening until he issued his report.\n\nThe Squamish band members in B.C. have asked the RCMP to investigate band finances. They have appealed to Indian affairs for help and were told that the department was only a funding agency, that it was not an investigative body, which is true. It is only a funding agency but it is also supposed to be a legislative agency.\n\nLast year the National Post ran an entire series of articles detailing the squalor and corruption on some reserves and the helplessness of band members to effect change. The need for such an officer became apparent to participants at grassroots meetings of aboriginals sponsored by the Reform MPs in the summer of 1998 and 1999. I was there and I would not have believed it if I had not seen it.\n\nThese meetings were held across Canada with a significant cross section of people attending. The idea of an aboriginal ombudsman came out of those meetings. One of its strongest supporters was Leona Freed who has emerged as the leader of a new group called First Nations Accountability Coalition. These people are calling for this, not us because we think we have all the solutions. We think that the people who are affected by legislation might also have some solutions.\n\nParticipants at these meetings charged band leadership with questionable allocation of band funds: refusals to conduct forensic audits when requested; jobs changing hands after band elections; nepotism, favouritism, cronyism; housing allocations to families and friends of chiefs and councillors; band leaders flying high on expense accounts, going all over the world to meetings and whatever; third world living conditions on wealthy reserves; misuse of dedicated funds meant for training, health, housing and land purchases; and any number of things. The government denies all of this, but from time to time it has to admit the facts in individual cases. However, it refuses to see a cause and effect relationship or to believe that anything can be done to improve the situation.\n\nThe Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has been of little or no use. Letters written in confidence to the minister have fallen into the wrong hands. What has been done? Allegation co-ordinators have been established to help with the work of co-ordinating allegations made, but they have no teeth, no authority to act and no investigative powers. What use they are is up in the air.\n\nIn 1997 several elders, led by Greg Twoyoungmen from Alberta, came to Ottawa to meet with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to talk about the problems on their reserves. What did they get from the minister? They got a closed door. The minister would not meet with them. The only people who would meet with them were the Reform Party critic and deputy critic for Indian affairs. Much of what we hear came from there as well.\n\nWho do these people turn to when all the doors are closed? The department of Indian affairs sends people back to their reserve leaders. The RCMP need significant proof before they can move. They cannot go to the courts for lengthy and expensive court battles on a civil basis because they simply do not have the funds available to them.\n\nIt was the grassroots Indians themselves who proposed the office of aboriginal ombudsman as an independent watchdog. They are convinced that an ombudsman will enable band members to exercise oversight into the affairs of bands in a way that is out of their grasp right now.\n\nOne of the better parts of this proposal is that the ombudsman would not serve at the pleasure of bands but would serve a fixed term of five years and not more than two terms. The ombudsman's pay cheque would not come from a band so his or her independence would be assured and he or she could not be called into question. The ombudsman would get assistance from the Chief Electoral Officer when needed to help settle disputes and would report to parliament annually.\n\nThe need for such legislation is clear. The bill is worthy of support by members of the House. I encourage every member to vote in favour of it, send it to committee and let the first nations leadership meet with the committee and give their views on it.\n\nIt would be a mistake to let some of the assertions from the other parties that have opposed this legislation, that what the Reform Party is saying is that all band membership is illegal and that is why this is needed, to go unanswered. That is not so. For the times it does, it hurts individuals. Many bands conduct their affairs in an open and businesslike way. They have nothing to fear from any legislation that is designed to protect individuals. Individuals are often hurt by that type of thing.\n\nThe critic for the Bloc characterized Indians as different from other people, that they sit around in circles and talk. When three or four people come to my office, we sit in a circle around my coffee table and we have a ceremonial drink. We call it coffee. We are pretty much alike when it comes to that type of thing. We gather in a circle, face one another and hash out the problems.\n\nThat is not the issue at all. The issue is protection of individual people who run afoul of a large bureaucratic organization that has economic, political and judicial power on its side. The people need an aboriginal ombudsman to protect them.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for introducing this critically important bill.\n\nOne profound tragedy in our country today is the existing situation for aboriginal people on and off reserve. The present government, previous governments and all Canadians have created an institutionalized welfare system in aboriginal communities. Through legislation we have put our heels on the necks of those people and have prevented them from having the same rights, responsibilities and obligations as other Canadians.\n\nIt is an insult to them that the government and previous governments have pursued these policies for such a long time. It will lead to the balkanization of our country. It will do nothing to address the fundamental problem of grassroots aboriginal people being dislocated from the wealth, the hope, the possibilities and prosperity that this country has to offer.\n\nThe government is empowering, albeit with honest intentions, the leadership of aboriginal people to rule. It is doing nothing to ensure that grassroots aboriginal people generate the control, responsibility and power to stand on their own two feet. That is why this bill is so important. It is important to have an ombudsman to ensure that grassroots aboriginal people are heard.\n\nI have some true stories to tell. I have worked with aboriginals for a long time on and off reserve and in emergency rooms. I have seen firsthand the devastation brought on by fetal alcohol syndrome, child abuse, sexual abuse and gross poverty. I have not seen this type of situation since I worked in Africa. There have been medical problems that I have not seen since I worked in the third world. It is going on in our country today.\n\nI implore the media to investigate what is happening in Nunavut, in northern Ontario, in northern Quebec, in Vancouver East and in northern British Columbia. This is not to say that all reserves or all aboriginal people are suffering from the same maladies. The incidence of poverty, medical problems and disempowered aboriginals is epidemic. We are ensuring that continues by virtue of the policies that are implemented in the House.\n\nWe want to empower grassroots people, but through the Nisga'a treaty and others we have done the exact opposite. We have empowered the people at the top. Time and time again grassroots aboriginal people have come to me saying they would like to send their children to school. But a lot of the money that is to go to the school to pay for books and teachers and to ensure that the kids get an education does not get there.\n\nThe elders in the aboriginal communities are saying that they would like to teach their people their traditional ways. Money has been allocated for that but it does not get to them. It disappears. Yet the chief and band council members drive expensive cars, live in expensive homes and go on expensive vacations while their people live in abject poverty.\n\nIf we were successful and if proposals made by the government and previous governments and the Conservative Party had worked, why is it that aboriginal communities have some of the highest rates of violence and sexual abuse? Their mortality figures are the highest. Maternal deaths are the highest. Infant mortality figures are well beyond anything in the non-aboriginal community. Why is it that their diabetes rates are four times higher than non-aboriginal communities? I could go on.\n\nIndividual grassroots aboriginal people are not empowered to stand on their own two feet. We are not giving them the same resources and legal tools which enable us to produce for ourselves, our families and our communities. By doing so we get self-respect. It is a myth to say that we can give people self-respect. People only get self-respect by taking it. We only get it by being able to support ourselves, our families and our communities.\n\nIt is up to the aboriginal leaders to take a different tack and control themselves. How can they ensure that their people are going to have the power to represent themselves as opposed to the present situation where a small cabal of people at the top controls the situation.\n\nSome aboriginal reserves work well under these conditions, the ones on the west coast in the Charlottes for example. There is responsible governance on the part of the people. They have invested the money the government has given them in ways which the people earn revenue. They have invested in the tools which give aboriginal people the education and the power to generate funds and work. They have healthy communities and live in congruence with their environment. This is what is taking place in some communities but unfortunately in many communities across the country that is not the case.\n\nI can only plead with the government for an ombudsman to ensure that aboriginal people are heard.\n\nWhen the current HRD minister was minister of Indian affairs, I went to her about situations in my riding. Children were falling into open sewers. Health Canada determined it to be a health hazard to the people living in the area. Yet it took years to get the money to the people so they could fix the problem. In part the leadership was not prepared to deal with these people in an honest way. This is what is happening.\n\nThe regional director could not intervene on behalf of the grassroots aboriginal people because the leadership in the community said no. The leadership in the community was compromising—and I am saying that nicely—the ability of the grassroots people to fix the problems on the reserve. If their own leadership will not speak for them, who will? The leadership, the director and the minister will not speak for them. If the minister just turns her face away and says that is the way it is, who will speak for these people? No one.\n\nIf non-aboriginal people suffered from the same type of nonsense that aboriginal people suffer from, they would not tolerate it because it would violate their basic rights. The basic rights of aboriginal people are being violated across Canada. As a result they are suffering from health problems and poverty.\n\nTo merely give them money will not work. It will not work to engage in a process of land claims that will balkanize the provinces. It is going to compromise the tax base of a province and its ability to work with people to provide resources for everybody. We are going to compromise the economy of those provinces for everybody.\n\nThe only people who will benefit from this are the people at the top in aboriginal communities. That is what is happening. The fact that the government is prepared to turn a blind eye and stick its head in the sand is one of the greatest tragedies of this country today. It is truly profound.\n\nWhen members of parliament visit an aboriginal reserve they will not see what is going on behind the scenes. They will fete us around to look at the nice things that are happening on the reserve. We will not go into people's homes to see them lying drunk at 10 o'clock in the morning on soiled mattresses, 10 to a room. We will not see the children with gross infections on their faces, sitting among adults, looking for basic parenting, looking for the basic care which all children deserve. They do not receive that care.\n\nUnderstandably, their societies are ill. If any of us were put in that environment, whether we were aboriginal or non-aboriginal, we would do the same thing. If we give people things all the time we create an institutionalized welfare state which takes the souls from human beings. It cuts away at the souls of the people. It destroys them from inside. That is why these people simply cannot get on their own feet, given the current situation and given the current legal tools which this government and previous governments have followed.\n\nIf this way of doing things were successful, then we would have seen a dramatic improvement in the health and welfare of aboriginal people. Have we? The answer is an obvious no. The longer we continue doing what we are doing, the longer this will continue.\n\nMembers from all political parties find the situation to be appalling. I know that all members of parliament want to do something about it. I know that all members want to work with aboriginal people to ensure that there is change. For God's sake, give those people the same rights and responsibilities that we have. They will flourish. They will teach us a great deal.\n\nIn 1967 former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau created a superb white paper. He recognized at that time that the way to aboriginal emancipation was through integration, not assimilation. Those were wise words then and they are wise words today. I can only implore the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Prime Minister to hearken back to that document which was created by Mr. Trudeau, read it again and listen to what he said. Within the context of that document is, in my view, in our view and I think in the heart of the Prime Minister, the way to ensure that aboriginal and non-aboriginal people will come together, respecting their differences, ensuring that the respective cultures and languages will flourish and ensuring that all people in this beautiful country will be empowered to be the best they can become.\n\nThe failure to acknowledge that, the failure to change the present course, which is a course of separation, a course of balkanization, will hurt not only aboriginal people but non-aboriginal people. That is something that all of us will have to live with for the rest of our lives. We can strive for something better.\n\nWe must work with grassroots aboriginal people, not necessarily the leadership. Normally these questions are dealt with by the leadership of aboriginal groups and parliamentarians. The discussion does not get to the people on the ground, who want the same things which we have. They want safety, they want hope, they want prosperity and they want a future. They want to live. They want their culture and language to survive in perpetuity. We want that and they want that. We would all benefit.\n\nWe cannot tolerate the present situation. It will ensure the ultimate cultural and social genocide of these people. That is something for which we as Canadians should never be proud.\n\nI hope that 20 years from now we will see that the Nisga'a treaty was a success. I truly hope for that. However, it is our view that it will not be the case.\n\nI hope that the government will see fit to work with us and to implement the solutions found in the document of former Prime Minister Trudeau for the sake of all Canadians.",
