This was the first time in 55 years that a Canadian delegation set foot on the gravesite to officially commemorate the valiant efforts of Pilot Officer Peers and his six crew members.\n\nThis weekend will be another first. French resistance fighters are presenting to the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 28 in Chatham-Kent their battle flag.

These mines and other potential diamond sites provide a much needed source of revenue for the territorial governments as well as employment opportunities for all northerners. The Ekati mine is expected to be in operation for 20 to 25 years and represents a $1 billion investment.\n\nThe Diavik project is currently waiting to find out if further environmental reviews will be undertaken. Diamond mining is environmentally friendly, but companies are awaiting ministerial approval. Hopefully it is soon coming.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words of tribute to a former colleague of ours, Alf Gleave, who at the age of 88 passed away in August of this year.\n\nAlf Gleave was the member of parliament for what was known then as the riding of Saskatoon—Biggar. I had the honour in 1968 to be his seatmate. He was 58 years old. I thought that was pretty ancient at that time as I was 22. I am beginning to see that it is a lot younger now than it used to be. Alf Gleave was a wonderful person to have as a seatmate.\n\nHe was elected to parliament in 1968. He was re-elected in 1972 and sat in the House until 1974.\n\nBefore he entered politics Mr. Gleave was a farmer. He farmed near the town of Biggar, Saskatchewan from 1938 until 1972. When he was elected to parliament he immediately became very well known, partly because he was the former president of the National Farmers' Union of Canada. When he was elected in 1968 he was chosen immediately as the chairman of the New Democratic Party caucus and he served in that position for a number of years.\n\nIn 1968 and 1969 we had a debate which was a bit like the debate we are having now. It was a debate over a farm crisis, mainly over what we called in those days tough and damp wheat or tough and damp grain. He quickly became a national figure, leading that debate in the House of Commons at a time when debates on public policy centred much more so in this place than they do today. He was a leader in that capacity for a long time.\n\nAlf Gleave was born in Ontario, but he moved to Saskatchewan when he was six years old. He farmed as a young man and he continued to farm until 1972. Before he entered politics he was the president of the National Farmers' Union of Canada, and before that he was the president of the Farmers' Union of Saskatchewan from 1949 until 1954. He was also a director of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. In 1964 he was appointed as a member of the Economic Council of Canada. He was also a director of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation and a number of other organizations in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1962 he served as an advisor to the federal government during the international wheat agreement negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Those were very important negotiations, which meant a lot to prairie farmers as they obtained an agreement for the export and sale of grain around the world.\n\nHe was also very active in the co-operative movement, the general co-op movement, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the credit union movement in our province, and indeed across the country.\n\nAfter his political career ended in 1974 he remained very active in many of the organizations that he had been active in before. He was also a regular columnist, having a bi-monthly column in The Saskatoon StarPhoenix on agricultural issues through much of the 1970s and 1980s. He was energetic. He was always involved. He always spoke with a great deal of compassion on issues concerning rural Canada, western Canada and agriculture in particular.\n\nIn 1991 he wrote a book called United We Stand . As Mr. Gleave passed away at the age of 88, he was up in years when he wrote this book. It is one of the more comprehensive histories that I have ever read of prairie farmers between 1901 and 1975.\n\nMr. Gleave was always very active. He was very effective in advancing the philosophy that when farm people and rural people are better off, the people in the cities and the towns across this country are also much better off, and that when the economy is strong on the farm, the economy of the country is also strong because agriculture indeed is the very foundation of our economy. I can remember him rising beside me through those six years, asking questions and making speeches which employed that philosophy time and time again.\n\nI would like to express on behalf of myself, my party and I am sure all members of parliament who knew him, our great respect for a very decent human being and for a very intelligent human being. He was a very passionate advocate of the causes of the farmers of this country, both before he got into politics, when he was in politics and after he left politics.\n\nI also want to extend our condolences to his wife Mary, who was always at his side, to his family and to his many friends, not only in Saskatchewan, but indeed right across Canada.",

Living in Biggar, Saskatchewan, with his family from 1918, he was first and foremost a farmer and very proud of it. He built his life in this honourable profession, so inherently important to the province of Saskatchewan. The farming community, in turn, looked to him for leadership on many issues. He was a life member of the National Farmers' Union. In the first 20 years of his working life he served as a director and then president of the Saskatchewan Farmers' Union and then the National Farmers' Union respectively. His dedication to farming will be fondly remembered by the people of the Biggar district and indeed by farmers all across Canada.\n\nHis deep commitments carried Mr. Gleave into the political arena. From 1968 until 1974 he was the elected member of parliament for the constituency of Saskatoon—Biggar. A member of the New Democratic Party, Mr. Gleave earned the respect of members from all parties. He was chairman of the NDP caucus from 1968 until 1972 and served as the party's agricultural critic.\n\nHis priorities were always clear in his writing, in his speeches and in the issues that he chose to pursue locally, nationally and internationally. One could never have any doubt about where he stood.\n\nIt is fitting, I suppose, that we mark his passing at a time when a federal byelection is under way to fill a vacancy in the House for the very riding which he once represented. Always a competitor, Alf Gleave would be thoroughly enjoying the race.\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Canada, I want to join all hon. members in extending our sympathies to his wife and family, as well as his very broad circle of friends.",

Alf wanted to do something for all of Saskatchewan. His quest and his goal was to do just that.\n\nHe served as president of the Saskatchewan Farmers' Union as well as the National Farmers' Union. He gave much of his time and provided Canada with much insight into the agricultural situation in Saskatchewan. As my hon. colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle mentioned, he also served on many boards, sometimes in an advisory capacity. He was indeed a credit to Saskatchewan.\n\nI bring to the House a quote of Alf's. He wrote that each generation must fight for what it wants because good things do not just happen. That statement was never more true than it is today. That is exactly why we will find a real fight going on in all of Saskatchewan, in all of the west, in the hope of saving, in many cases, fifth generation farmers from complete disaster.\n\nFarmers who lived through the thirties did not just complain about the living conditions; they went out and did something about them. Sometimes adversity brings about strong character. That is exactly what Alf Gleave gave to Canada, to the House and to the New Democratic Party.\n\nI am proud to have lived very close for 12 years to the seat that Alf represented in the House.\n\nIt was Alf's sincerity, courage and dedication that has made a tremendous example for people to follow that goes beyond political parties.\n\nOn behalf of my party and on behalf of all of the people in the House, I want to extend our condolences to his family and to everyone everywhere in Canada who remembered him fondly.",

As he wrote in the introduction to his autobiographical United We Stand—Prairie Farmers 1901-1975 :\n\n“Political action was an extension of the farmer's movement. I used it as well as I could to advance western Canadians' interests in general and the farmer's movement in particular.”\n\nDuring the six years he sat in the House, he was an ardent defender of farmers and a formidable member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. He was a feisty MP, as my colleague and friend, the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona, just told me.\n\nHe was particularly interested in issues having to do with the price of wheat, farm marketing boards, price controls and inflation. He served as president of his party's caucus and also served a leader, David Lewis who, like his predecessor, Tommy Douglas, was, in his words, and I am again quoting from United We Stand , “an outstanding man”.\n\nTo a man whose efforts gave meaning to the slogan “Humanity first” of the CCF, the forerunner to the New Democratic Party, to the man who also toiled on behalf of his family, his constituents and his fellow citizens for\n\n“a more secure and bountiful life for themselves by working together, by sharing the load”,\n\nmembers of the Bloc Quebecois pay a final tribute, and to the family and friends of the late Alf Gleave, present their deepest condolences.",

I suspect that Mr. Gleave had a great sense of humour. I suspect he had a great deal of endurance. I wish he had more years in the House so that he could have passed on some of his experience to the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.\n\nMr. Gleave gave years of his life working for the people of Saskatchewan, whether it was through his involvement with co-operatives, as president of the Saskatchewan Farmers Union or as a member of this House.\n\nI did not know Mr. Gleave personally but I know people like Mr. Gleave, an individual who took farming as a profession, an individual who had pride in what he did by working the land. He was a man who worked for his community, a man who worked for his neighbours and a man who worked for his profession, that of being a farmer. I know people, as do members of the opposition and the government, just like Mr. Gleave.\n\nMr. Gleave died this past summer at the age of 88. His words of advice during his tenure as member of parliament still ring true today. As was mentioned by the member of the Reform Party, and which is important to repeat, Mr. Gleave talked about how each generation must fight for what they want because good things do not just happen. Good things come to people through hard work, endurance and perseverance. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to work and to sit in the House with Mr. Gleave because what I read and hear of him is more of those traits that I wish more individuals in the House and certainly in this society would have.\n\nI extend my condolences on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to the surviving members of the Gleave family.

His interest was certainly the farm and he adopted the motto that people are important.\n\nAs a young individual in the farm movement in the early seventies, there were several people who inspired me to become involved in public life. Alf was one of those people to me.\n\nI had many sessions with Alf over the years, but after coming here in 1993 as a member on the government side and as a member of the standing committee on agriculture, it was not unusual at all to see Alf in his older years sitting in the agricultural committee room listening to the hearings. He was interested in what all sides were saying. He gave some us on the government side a lot of criticism at times for some of the things we were doing, but his belief showed through in terms of how important it was that programs and benefits be applied to the farm sector.\n\nI join with all others here today who have recognized Alf Gleave for his life's work.

Since that time, tens of thousands of conditional sentences have been handed down. Most of these sentences are for petty crimes. However many have been handed down for crimes as serious as sexual assault, manslaughter, drunk driving and drug trafficking.\n\nIn 1997 the B.C. Court of Appeal stated in a decision regarding conditional sentencing that “if parliament had intended to exclude certain offences from consideration it should have done so in clear language”.\n\nMy bill does precisely that. It lists the offences to be excluded from any possibility of receiving a conditional sentence. The justice minister wants Canadians to wait for the supreme court to decide whether or not conditional sentences are appropriate. I believe these decisions are to be made in parliament with direction from Canadians, not the courts.\n\nA recent national poll states that 84% of Canadians are in favour of this bill. I encourage all members of parliament to support the bill and the overwhelming view of the majority of Canadians.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, at the outset of my remarks, as we are responding to the Speech from the Throne that opened this session of parliament, I would once again like to thank the people of my riding of Ottawa South for their continuing support. I believe it is a great privilege to serve as a member of the House of Commons and I am proud to serve my constituents, as well as the people of Canada, in my capacity as Minister of Industry.\n\nI am also very proud to have the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne which I believe lays out a balanced agenda and establishes a solid foundation for the government to move forward into the 21st century.\n\nIt is among the chief responsibilities of the Minister of Industry to try to prepare the nation for the challenges of the future, knowing that what the world we will face in a decade will probably differ from the nineties even more than this decade has differed from the eighties. This is the reason I have dedicated myself over the past six years to helping foster innovation, science, research and development, and connectedness.\n\nYear by year, our government has endeavoured to help Canadians build a new economy through policies and programs whose sights have been set on the 21st century.\n\nFor example, we invested a billion dollars in the Canada Foundation for Innovation to help build the research infrastructure in Canada.\n\nWe created the Canada millennium scholarship fund. This January, we will begin generating over 100,000 scholarships each year to low- and middle-income post-secondary students.\n\nWe launched an Information Highway agenda—Connecting Canadians—to make Canada the most connected country in the world by the year 2000. Let is looks at some of the results.\n\nIn Rankin Inlet in the High Arctic people have made the transition from an isolated and remote community to the global exchange of ideas and commerce. The Internet gives them a window on the world and opens an opportunity for them to express themselves to the world.\n\nIn Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Gordon Curries, working out of his home office, beat out the competition from the big international publishing houses to win the contract to produce the official coffee table book on the Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\nIn York, Prince Edward Island, Vesey's Seeds has used electronic commerce to increase sales equivalent to opening a brand new store with none of the overhead costs that would have been the case otherwise.\n\nLanark County in Ontario, not far from Ottawa, has its model on its website that speaks of the ability of the net to make distance irrelevant. “Ten seconds to Tokyo, ten minutes to the cottage, what a life” is its slogan.\n\nOur policies, our priorities, and our investments have made an impact on the lives of Canadians. But the government can make investments in tomorrow because it has restored sanity to the nation's finances today.\n\nCanadians enabled us to achieve a balanced budget because they were prepared to endure sacrifices, allowing us to consider how to allocate surpluses rather than how to reduce deficits.\n\nThe Speech from the Throne continues to build on these investments. It continues the same balanced approach that has succeeded so well over the past six years. At the same time, it commits this government to keeping the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track, and it promises a multi-year plan for tax reduction.\n\nI would like to speak about an important objective of the throne speech, creating a dynamic economy for the 21st century. Our goal is as simple as branding Canada as one of the most forward looking and innovative nations in the world.\n\nWhen future generations look back at the turbulent years on the cusp of the new millennium, they will see that some nations thrived in the midst of change. They rallied to the new demands of creating knowledge and applying it to new products and processes. When those future generations look back at who thrived in the transition to the new millennium, they will conclude that Canada was the place to be.\n\nThe 1999 Speech from the Throne reinforces the government's commitment to its long term strategy for building a more innovative economy. By deepening its action in five priority areas of its microeconomic agenda: connectedness, innovation, marketplace frameworks, trade and investment, the government continues its drive to ensure that Canada is a winner in the globalized knowledge based economy. It will make major investments in productivity enhancing actions, productivity that will continue to sustain one of the highest standards of living in the world and improve the quality of life of all Canadians.\n\nWith the Chairs in Research Excellence program, the government has committed to work with the universities to create 1,200 new 21st century chairs in research excellence over the next three years. We have set a goal of 2,000 of these new chairs in research excellence. The chairs will enable Canadian universities to continue to attract the best graduate and post-doctoral students that can create real excitement around research in Canadian universities.\n\nResearch will be collaborative. In the 21st century, research will not be a solitary pursuit, conducted in the isolation of separate ivory towers. It will involve team-building and co-operation, domestically and internationally, so that innovation moves through the continuum from pure research to new products and processes. We will foster international collaboration and networking by Canadian researchers in universities and institutes, including the federal research facilities. In the area of technological development, we will encourage the development of technologies in every phase of the innovation continuum. This includes research collaboration in genomics, climate change and advanced engineering, trade promotion for biotechnology, information technology, and environmental technologies.\n\nOn market development, we will help to find new markets for the products of Canadian innovation and ingenuity. We will help to ensure that new innovations developed by researchers in our universities and government laboratories translate into new products in the marketplace.\n\nForeign investment is investment that brings with it technological innovation and improved access to the markets of our trading partners. It is investment that helps make Canadian industry more forward looking and more outward looking. We will replicate the highly successful team Canada model of trade initiatives and with our partners in business and the provincial governments will create investment team Canada.\n\nIn the Speech from the Throne we stated our commitment to make the investment community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada. We said: “We will modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada”. Consistent with this commitment, we will put forward amendments to the Canada Business Corporations Act to ensure that it provides an operating environment that can attract and retain the world's best firms.\n\nIn particular we will propose to reduce the current residency requirement for the board of directors of companies incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act from a majority to 25%.\n\nThis requirement will not apply to corporations where there are ownership restrictions. We recognize that a modern framework legislation must provide globally-oriented Canadian companies with the flexibility to build their global markets, investments and partnerships for the benefit of Canadians and jobs in Canada.\n\nI am very pleased that many initiatives in the Speech from the Throne advance an agenda that has been a personal priority for me in my six years as industry minister. I refer to the Connecting Canadians initiative.\n\nWe have already gone a long way to making Canada the most connected nation in the world. Last March, Industry Canada's SchoolNet program linked a three-student school in Pictou Island, Nova Scotia, to the Internet.\n\nWith that, Canada achieved a visionary goal. Every Canadian public school, first nations school and public library wanting to be connected by the SchoolNet partnership has been brought on line. Canada has won a race where speed was of the essence. It is a race where the countries of the world that can train their populations with Internet skills will enjoy the benefits of a knowledge based economy. We are the first country in the world to build such an extensive education network, a network that connects these schools and their communities to the world.\n\nIn this session of parliament, we will push forward on the next phase of our SchoolNet program. We will increase classroom access to high speed Internet service. We will stimulate the production of Canadian multimedia content and applications.\n\nWe will recruit up to 10,000 young people to help Canadians to become better users of the Internet. These young people will train those in their communities who want to learn how to go on line and how to use the wealth of information that is available to them in that medium. They will help small businesses set up websites and use e-commerce. They will ensure the community access sites have the expertise needed for the delivery of government services over the net.\n\nA fundamental goal of our Connectedness Agenda has been to make government a model user of the information highway—to become known around the world as the government most connected to its citizens. We aim to achieve this by 2004.\n\nWe will do this, in part, through an Internet site that will serve as a personal gateway for Canadians wanting government information and community content. The Internet site will also lead the world to Canadian businesses.\n\nFinally, I do not want to leave the topic of our Connectedness Agenda without emphasizing our commitment to finishing the work we started in the last session to make Canada a centre of excellence in e-commerce.\n\nBy the end of the year 2000, we intend to have the most attractive policy environment for electronic commerce in the world. We are building a policy framework that deals with: encryption technology, public key infrastructure, consumer protection, electronic signatures, equitable tax treatment of virtual transactions, and standards to ensure the interoperability of networks and applications.\n\nThese are the cornerstones of electronic commerce. The government has reintroduced and the House has adopted the personal information protection and electronic documents act. It will protect personal and business information in the digital world and recognize electronic signatures. It is part of our vision to connect Canadians, to promote innovation in Canada and to brand Canada as a world leader in the knowledge based economy.\n\nThe Prime Minister has challenged Canadian businesses, especially small businesses, to take advantage of the opportunities for electronic commerce. He has challenged all sectors of Canada's economy to capture 5% of the world share of e-commerce by 2003. That would equate to $200 billion in business every year.\n\nThe government has looked at the opportunities of the future as well as the challenges. We have identified the gaps that remain in our ability to meet those demands. Through a comprehensive agenda of policies and programs, we will fill those gaps. We will fill them with targeted programs and at the same time continue the prudent, balanced approach to making the best possible use of taxpayers' money. In this way we make Canada the place to be for all those who want to be part of a dynamic, forward looking, knowledge based economy.\n\nI want especially to commend the vision shown by the Prime Minister in promoting an agenda that looks forward to how Canadians will prosper in the next century. His vision has ensured that the government's agenda is built on programs that will promote science and technology, research and development, and skills and knowledge. He has promoted an agenda for innovation. With this vision, Canada will be the best place to live in the next century.",

That is very true.\n\nRegardless of where we live, whether Latulipe, Sainte-Germaine, Montreal, Toronto, or anywhere else, access to technologies like the Internet brings us all closer together. We have access to a great deal of information. In theory, this gives many people an equal opportunity.\n\nIn reality, however, a problem is becoming more and more obvious. I would like to ask the minister's opinion on it Among other things, with telephone deregulation, which is not without its drawbacks, we are beginning to realize that, within a few years, the basic rate for service in areas serviced by certain telephone companies will be close to $40, while it will be half that in other areas.\n\nSince access to the Internet requires a line and connection, is the minister not concerned that people in some areas will have to pay twice what others are paying to be hooked up to this technology?\n\nMunicipalities and schools will be connected, certainly, but more and more people want access at home as well. Some of them will have access via their phone line, while others will have an Internet line as part of their basic service. According to the latest CRTC decision, Internet service will have to be part of the basic service.\n\nIs the minister concerned by the fact that the charges for basic telephone services will be twice as high in some areas as in others, depending on the company providing service? In my region, basic service has risen to over $30, while it is around the $20 mark in other regions. In two years, it will be $40 for us, and $20 for them.\n\nIs the minister not concerned about this trend? Does the Minister of Industry intend to intervene, and not just to rely on CRTC decisions in this area?",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is a good one.\n\nFirst off, I will say that introducing competition into the telecommunications sector has produced significant benefits. There have been reductions in price, especially for long distance calls. Our rates are now lower than those of the United States, where there is a flurry of rate reductions.\n\nCompetition is so strong here in Canada that the rates for most Canadians, and this has been the case for a long time as well in Europe, are lower than in the United States. This is a factor of competition between Canada and the United States that is so favourable to us that we can look for investment.\n\nProblems remain. In more rural or remote regions, the cost of services is higher. There are differences in prices because competition has lowered them for long distance calls. We are in a price adjustment period. We continue to have the greatest access to telephones in the world, with an access rate of some 99%.\n\nSo almost everyone has access to the telephone system. As mentioned, the CRTC has decided to include in the definition of basic service, access to the Intranet through a local line. That means as well, digital service and single service. These changes will come.\n\nIn situations like the one mentioned in Question Period, where significant differences exist in a very small region, I advise him to raise the matter with the CRTC. It has the power to investigate and solve problems when it is satisfied that there is an affordability problem or there are unjustified situations.\n\nThat is a short term response. In the long term, we have to be the most connected country in the world, and I totally agree that we will have to concern ourselves with providing access for everyone, not only at home but also, and immediately, in community access centres, schools and libraries.",

Fortunately it is not that often when we consider how much development is occurring at the present time in essentially rewiring our urban areas with fibre optic facilities, in many cases replacing the cables that were already there or providing additional cable services, or, and this has sometimes been even more problematic, providing the cells for wireless service in prominent locations in enough places in a locality. The policy that has been followed is one that tries to co-operate as fully as possible with the municipalities, both in terms of obtaining access and corresponding with local concerns with respect to zoning and other considerations.\n\nI think at the end of the day the necessity that every citizen has to the availability of telecommunications services is one that takes a high level of precedence. Where it is not possible to reconcile, sometimes it is necessary that access be determined by other means.\n\nIn a municipality if there is the need to put in significant upgrades to services, I think it would be a very short period of time before citizens became sufficiently demanding of those services. Municipal governments as well would be anxious to find ways to satisfy that.\n\nIt is also important to remember that the cost of those services needs to be taken into account in our competitive position. Probably every municipality in Canada is always looking for new ways to earn some revenue, but it is important that we not build on to the cost of telecommunications services too many additional charges which then render our costs higher than those elsewhere, not just between municipalities but between Canada and the U.S. where that cost advantage is so important to attracting investment.",

If I were a fisherman in northern Saskatchewan wanting to sell pickerel somewhere, I could easily find some buyer through e-commerce, but the freshwater fish industry is regulated under freshwater fish marketing rules. I could not go to interprovincial or international trade because of the fish.

I mention Gordon Currie from Dawson Creek, British Columbia whose clients are not necessarily in British Columbia. One is the Atlanta Olympic Committee.

This is all about where the jobs are going to be in the next 10 years and how we can create them.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.\n\nI am pleased to take part in today's debate on the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. As the Bloc Quebecois environment critic, I will primarily focus on the promises made by the federal government in that area and on the initiatives that it should be taking to ensure sustainable development and preserve nature for the benefit of future generations.\n\nI want to preface my remarks with quotes from a document published this year by the federal government, entitled “Survey on the Importance of Nature to Canadians”.\n\nThis survey, which involved 86,000 Canadians aged 15 or over, confirms the importance of natural resources, fauna and flora for a vast majority of people. Indeed, it shows that, during the 1996 reference year, 29 million Canadians and Quebecers, or 85% of the population, took part in nature-related activities, for a total of 1.5 billion days. These nature-related activities generated 191 million trips and expenses totalling $11 billion.\n\nAll these figures are telling me two important things. First, Canadians and Quebecers are keen participants in nature-related activities. This is why we must preserve our fauna, forests and protected areas, so that we can all continue to fully enjoy them.\n\nSecond, these activities have a significant economic impact, whether we are talking about outdoor activities, sports or the tourism industry. Regardless of what those who believe ecology is not compatible with economic development may think, the fact is that our environment is a profitable asset that must be preserved and developed.\n\nUnfortunately, since it took office in 1993, the Liberal government did very little to protect the environment. Its rare initiatives were primarily designed to encroach on provincial jurisdictions and strengthen the federal government's control over natural resources rather than truly protect the environment.\n\nThe only good news is that the Liberal government seems to have woken up, probably having realized that it should not head into the next election empty-handed. But yes, let us take a quick look at a few of the measures proposed in the throne speech.\n\nThe government promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the Liberals initially promised in their red book to reduce emissions by 20% by 2005—that is right, 20% by the year 2005—we recently learned that greenhouse gases have instead gone up by 20% since 1990.\n\nThat is why Bloc Quebecois members will continue to make every possible effort to hold this government—because this is essential—to the commitments it made in Kyoto, to set itself specific goals and to take firm action to achieve them.\n\nThe government also intends to protect endangered species. We will continue to denounce interference in provincial jurisdictions and the lack of resources to monitor and protect endangered species. Instead of setting national standards, the federal government should provide funding—that is what it should be doing—for preserving the habitats of these endangered species.\n\nThe most sensible proposal in the throne speech was the one to clean up contaminated federal sites. Finally, a ray of hope. The government has been promising to do this for years. Finally, it seems prepared to go ahead. I am giving it the benefit of the doubt, but I intend to keep a close eye on developments.\n\nThis should be the priority of the federal government: to clean up its own backyard before telling the provinces what to do with theirs. This clean-up should also include sites contaminated by the Canadian army, such as those in my riding of Jonquière.\n\nAs I see time is passing, I will deal with a very important matter left out of the throne speech, that of genetically modified organisms. The Canadian position on the matter of the negotiation of the protocol on biodiversity is unacceptable. Over 100 countries are prepared to sign an agreement to regulate the labelling, import and export of genetically modified organisms, primarily plants, and a liability clause for companies regarding damage to the environment caused by their products.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada is part of a small group, with the United States and four other countries, that is blocking these negotiations because they are bent on putting exports ahead of the health of Canadians and the security of their environment.\n\nI will close my remarks with a look at the decision by Jean Chrétien to permit the import into Canada of a fuel containing plutonium, also known as MOX.\n\nI held a press conference this morning to oppose the import of this product from the United States and Russia, without public consultation on the principle. I pointed out as well the unresolved problems of storing radioactive waste once the MOX has been used as a fuel in nuclear plants.\n\nI can only deplore the attitude of the Minister of the Environment in this matter. While he should be concerned about clean sources of energy and sustainable development, the minister has presented nuclear energy as an attractive solution that would reduce greenhouse gases. The minister has even advocated exporting Canadian nuclear technology abroad.\n\nWhen I questioned him on the subject of his government's proposal to import some one hundred tonnes of plutonium from Russian and American nuclear arms, the minister had nothing to say.\n\nI hope he will quickly change his course in this matter, as in others, and attend to his mandate as Minister of the Environment. For this and a number of other reasons, I must tell the government it is time to act on the environment. It must do so to give future generations a safe environment.",

            "text": "It is always a pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to take the floor when you are in the chair.\n\nI would like to express our great disappointment with this throne speech. I believe it can be characterized quite simply as a throne speech offering little in the way of concrete solutions to people's concerns. It is the mark of a government that is coming to the end of its time.\n\nI invite the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to reflect on this, and I trust that he will have some questions to ask me at the end of my speech, because I am always pleased to exchange views with him. I invite him to remember how different things would be in this House if the Bloc Quebecois were not here to promote the legitimate interests of Quebec.\n\nIf we were not here, the government would be left to its own device, with its rather monolithic view of Quebec. I am taking this opportunity to tell you that we will not let the government interfere in the referendum debate.\n\nI am well aware that, if it were up to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, given his penchant for controversy—and I believe he will allow me to say this—he would want to legislate here, in this parliament, on the referendum question, even though, as we all know, Quebec already has a referendum act. The decision will be made in a democratic fashion.\n\nGuess what percentage of Quebecers took part in the 1995 referendum? Some 93.5%. This compares favourably to the figures obtained where voting is compulsory.\n\nI am asking the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to calm down a little, to control himself, to not add fuel to the fire and to accept that this issue will be dealt with by the National Assembly and by Quebecers, who will have to make a choice.\n\nIncidentally—and this will be of interest to my friend, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs—this past weekend I attended a congress with the rank and file in my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. Whenever my constituents were given the opportunity to vote for sovereignty, they did so in very interesting numbers.\n\nI am not an illegitimate son of sovereignty. I am a natural son of sovereignty, considering that every time the people in my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve had an opportunity to vote for sovereignty, they did so. In fact, the minister know who the first Parti Quebecois member elected at the National Assembly was. We will recall fondly that it was Robert Burns, who now sits on the bench.\n\nI want to tell the House about a victory for democracy that took place in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I put the following idea, which will interest the minister, to those attending the congress. In the coming days, I would like to campaign to have the Commission des institutions convene a constituent assembly with a four-fold mandate.\n\nFirst, I would like Quebecers to be consulted about the wording of the next referendum question. Naturally, it would still be up to the National Assembly to decide whether or not to adopt it, but it would be interesting for Quebecers to be consulted. This would prevent the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and all the other ministers in this cabinet from saying that the question is not legitimate, because it would be based on what people wanted.\n\nSecond, I would like a constituent assembly to look into what could be called “new democratic practices”. In a sovereign Quebec—it should not be long now—what kind of ballot do we want? How can we ensure that decision-making is a truer reflection of representation? These are questions that could be raised in the context of a constituent assembly.\n\nThird—and I know that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs will be interested in this as well—we must give some thought to a question facing modern nations. This is not something limited to Quebec or Canada. It is a question that I would say all modern nations must consider. How are we to define “citizen” as a concept? In Quebec, the view which I think is most widely held right now is that, in a sovereign Quebec, citizenship will be defined in relation to participation in a shared public culture.\n\nThis shared public culture has a number of components. First, of course, it must be rooted in French. The language of democratic participation in a sovereign Quebec will of course be French. Naturally, we hope that there will be wide participation in democratic life and in institutions. We also hope to benefit from the contribution of other communities in a context of genuine collaboration and mutual dialogue.\n\nA constituent assembly could therefore make proposals for the wording of the referendum question, examine the issue of new democratic practices, and consider the concept of citizenship by consulting people about participation in institutions. I myself spent a few days in the United States and was trained by former congressman Kennedy, who has since left political life—but I confess I had nothing to do with it—and he explained very clearly to me the benefits of a law that, in the end, permits American legislators to measure the involvement of banks in poor communities.\n\nI must say, to my great satisfaction, that this proposal was greeted with barely contained enthusiasm. It will now make its way through the regional bodies to the Bloc Quebecois Year 2000 congress. I would very much like the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to agree to exchange views with me on these matters.\n\nNow, returning to the Speech from the Throne, although I do not believe I have ever strayed away from it totally, finally, as far as the government's constitutional strategy is concerned, we can see an imprecise outline of the underlying agenda of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.\n\nI would once again caution him against the desire to legislate here, in this parliament, on a matter that does not concern him in the least. Moreover, I am told that the minister—a likeable man, as is common knowledge—is a man becoming increasingly the only one on side with his strategy. I trust that we will have the opportunity to discuss this together, he and I.\n\nI would have liked to have seen some concrete measures contained in this throne speech, lacklustre as it is, with no bite, no relief, a total lack of imagination. What would prevent the government from including in the Human Rights Act—not in the Charter, since this would require an amending formula, as we know—social condition as a forbidden grounds for discrimination?\n\nSeven provinces already have such a thing in their legislation or in their human rights codes, and it would be a formidable weapon in the battle against poverty. We are very well aware that social condition refers to people's degree of wealth, their position in society, their place in the means of production. What would have prevented the government from passing legislation, as the United States did in 1977, on community reinvestment by the banks?\n\nThe Americans have what they call the Community Reinvestment Act. I myself spent a few days in the U.S. and was instructed by former congressman Kennedy who, since then, has left politics— and I had nothing to do with that—and who explained to me in very practical terms the benefits from this Act, which basically allows American lawmakers to measure the banks' involvement in disadvantaged communities.\n\nI will now focus on another issue, namely tainted blood. This is a stigma, a matter of shame for all parliamentarians. So long as the government does not correct the situation, there will be a pall over all of the House of Commons. The government ought to correct the situation, and I am referring, naturally, to the Krever commission.\n\nThis is a scandal, a real catastrophe. In the early 1990s, Canadian blood supplies were contaminated for all sorts of reasons. It is nevertheless true that, in its report—a report not prepared by the Bloc Quebecois, a report by a royal commission of inquiry that cost taxpayers millions of dollars and needed to be called—the Krever commission called for a no fault compensation system. That means that everyone contaminated either through a transfusion or through the use of blood products would be compensated.\n\nI would like everyone to stay, but acknowledge that is impossible. I know that those who must leave always do so out of necessity. I would have liked a debate with the minister, but that is not possible. We will have it in other forums. I think he may be a bit afraid of a confrontation with me, but that is part of parliamentary life.\n\nI close by saying that I wished the Krever commission had been heard and that we were establishing a compensation plan without regard to the fault of those contaminated before 1986 as for those contaminated before 1990. It is a matter of humanitarian consideration. Quebec and Ontario have already compensated these categories. The government is turning a deaf year, and I think it is shameful it is taking such an attitude.",

I too work with the disadvantaged and the poor in my riding of Matapédia—Matane. Since my riding is in a remote region, communications are not so good. Major companies and multinationals are reluctant to come to my riding, if only because the airport is located in Mont-Joli and it takes close to one hour to get to the airport from my home. Given the transportation services available, this is already a problem.\n\nI clearly recall the case of a local plant. The owners said “We are leaving the plant in Quebec City, because if we move it further east, it will mean an additional half-hour drive, because there is no air service, and half an hour is a long time for business people”.\n\nThe hon. member talked about a sovereign Quebec, and I know that he has given a great deal of thought to this issue.

If he took the trouble to listen more closely to the opposition parties, I think he would see a certain light that is sadly lacking in his caucus. That having been said, on the issue of poverty, I think that it involves all parliamentarians.\n\nWhy do we want to become sovereign? Because we are a nation, but we are also a nation that believes strongly in social justice. Right now, even the best governments that have sat in the National Assembly have been unable to implement a genuine policy of resource distribution and full employment.\n\nThey have been unable to do so because monetary policy is decided in Ottawa. The major levers for regulating the labour market are in the hands of the Minister of Finance, and the Government of Quebec has tools that are very secondary but that make dialogue between the parties impossible.\n\nMembers are well aware that the countries—I am thinking of Sweden and Norway—that have come close to achieving full employment have been successful in getting employers, union representatives, representatives of community groups, educators and, of course, economic decision makers to sit down together, to agree on a certain number of objectives, and to implement them. In a federal system such as ours, this is not possible.\n\nI will give an example. It is well known that the federal government has turned around and deprived the provinces of close to $11 billion in transfer payments. Do members think that this began with a dialogue and that the provinces were involved in these macroeconomic decisions? Of course not. This was authority speaking. It shows that federalism is incompatible with the full employment policies that Quebec will implement when it gains control of all these levers as a sovereign state.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Peterborough.\n\nIn a sense my remarks directly relate to what was just said.\n\nMy speech will deal mainly with early childhood, and the challenge of finding the means to work along with the provinces. I believe we can make considerable progress together.\n\nHow can we as governments, federal, provincial and territorial, work together with communities to support children and their families, particularly very young children, so that the development of those children can be as good as we can collectively make it? That is my subject.\n\nThe reason I have chosen that subject, in the context of the Speech from the Throne, is something which the Prime Minister said in his response to the Speech from the Throne. He said “Together with the provinces we have begun to put in place the national children's agenda to improve supports for families and children. I believe this work has to be accelerated. So do provincial premiers. We must move as quickly as possible from talk to action. Today I challenge all governments to have in place by December 2000 a federal-provincial agreement consistent with the social union framework to strengthen supports for early childhood development, an agreement on principles and objectives on measuring outcomes and reporting to Canadians and an agreement on a five year timetable for increased federal and provincial funding to achieve our shared objectives”.\n\nThe challenge is how we can do such a deal. How can we work with the other governments in the country to do the right deal and not just any deal for children? How can we do it in about 14 months? How can we do it by December 2000?\n\nI think the only way we can conceive of a deal is to think of it as sort of a national project for all of our children.\n\nWe have a number of elements of success in place already. The first is perhaps the whole question of knowledge. What do we know about optimum developmental paths for all children, particularly those in the zero to six population? As the finance minister said yesterday in his annual economic update, quoting Dr. Fraser Mustard, “There is powerful new evidence from neuroscience that the early years of development, from conception to age six, particularly for the first three years, set the base for competence and coping skills that will affect learning, behaviour and health throughout life”.\n\nThe science also tells us that an additional factor for success is what we do at the community level. It is not simply a question of socioeconomic status, it is what happens at the level where we all live and breath, the level of the neighbourhood. Social cohesion is a positive factor which goes beyond income in explaining why some kids do better than others. There was a recent article in the Globe and Mail on Port Colborne, Ontario which talked about “wovenness” as being the magic, the secret which takes us beyond income into good results for kids.\n\nThe first asset that we can bring to the table is the knowledge base which is growing exponentially in this area. The second is that the provinces are increasingly on side. It was extraordinary to hear the recent Speech from the Throne from Ontario in which the lieutenant governor said these words on behalf of her government:\n\nYour government believes that, to realize their full potential, children must get off to the best possible start in life. The most important period of development is the three years immediately following birth. That is why it is so important to nurture and support children's development from the moment they are born.\n\nBuilding on the pioneering work of world renowned expert Dr. Fraser Mustard and child advocate the Hon. Margaret McCain, the government is committed to a bold new initiative that ultimately will extend early development opportunities to every child and parent in Ontario. Recently announced demonstration projects are merely the beginning. Your government is determined to remain the national leader in early child development.\n\nThat is the Government of Ontario. It is surprising perhaps to some, considering its other social policies, but that is a great one.\n\nWe know that in British Columbia the Hon. Moe Sihota recently announced a major new initiative in the area of child care and invited federal participation once again.\n\nWe are very familiar with the case of Quebec, which made a societal promise to its children, particularly its very young ones, with its $5-a-day child care centres. They are a kind of gold standard for the rest of the country. They are the summit we are all striving to reach, to use the vocabulary of social union.\n\nWe can find allies among the provinces across the country. In a meeting held in Kananaskis with the social services ministers as recently as October 26, ministers said the following:\n\nMinisters also reviewed joint work currently under way in both social services and health sectors on early childhood development, including possible areas where governments can work together. Ministers agreed that this work should form the basis for responding to the federal government's invitation in the Speech from the Throne to work together in this area. They committed to working with federal, provincial, and territorial ministers of health to move forward as quickly as possible on early childhood development.\n\nThe next day their counterparts, the ministers who constitute the provincial-territorial council on social policy renewal, made the same point:\n\nMinisters stressed the urgent need for action on children's issues, building on the leadership taken by provinces and territories and the co-operative work with the federal government. Ministers emphasized the need to move forward on the national children's agenda.\n\nNow seems to be the time for us all to go forward, as we have the provinces enthusiastically responding to the Speech from the Throne.\n\nOf all the assets we can bring to the table, including our own efforts, the knowledge base and the provinces, the greatest assets surely are the communities themselves. Communities are where we live and breathe. Communities are where our children develop through schools, through play contacts, through all of the things which make life worth living in our private lives.\n\nI find this the most exciting part. This morning I was at a breakfast meeting in Ottawa-Carleton with the Success by Six group, an extraordinary alliance spearheaded by the Ottawa-Carleton Board of Education and the United Way, bringing together 85 different entities, agencies, the voluntary sector and government departments, to work together to improve outcomes for the zero to six population. The spirit of enterprise and excitement in the room of working together to produce a kind of seamless web of services so that all children and their parents will be given optimum support was tremendous. It was heartening. We have in the nation's capital a demonstration project, one chosen by the Ontario government as well.\n\nLast week I was in Toronto with a similar group, called the Early Years Action Group, from North York. It is happening across the country. In Vancouver we can find Opportunities for Youth. In Montreal we have Un Deux Trois Go. In other words, we have a huge resource base.\n\nWe have allies like the United Way of Canada, which we are aware of this month as its flags are fluttering across Canada to remind us of the annual campaign. This network covers 87% of Canada. There is a huge sector of civil society that wants to participate in the national children's agenda.\n\nWhat do we need to do? We need a deal which is something like the Canada Health Act. The Prime Minister talks of objectives and principles. We also need a deal which deals with outcomes. The Prime Minister talks of outcomes and accountability in public reporting. We need a deal which has money. The money has to come in the form of an early childhood development services fund, with resources coming from the provinces and the federal government, accessed by communities after they have determined what they need to do the right job for kids from birth to six, so that those children will be ready to learn and ready for life by the time they enter the school system.\n\nThat is what we need to do. It means that we have to sign on a group of provinces. It means that we have to see working examples in the next 12 months of how communities can work together, such as they are doing in Ottawa-Carleton and in Ontario in general.\n\nWe need a plan which focuses on all children and, as Minister Marland of Ontario said the other day, a plan which is affordable, available and accessible to all children.\n\nWe have a huge task to complete this part of the promise of the Speech from the Throne. It will involve all of us in all of our communities doing our best to work with the provincial governments, the federal government, communities and the voluntary sector to make this dream of a national project of making all of Canada's children as ready to learn as they possibly can be by the time they enter school a reality.",

Could he give some sense of that? Also, could he give us his thoughts on how that subcommittee might proceed, or is it going to proceed? What is it likely to do between now and the budget when we hope that many of the things in the Speech from the Throne will become engraved in stone?",

So far we have only been able to produce an interim report.\n\nFirst it is important to say that we are an all-party committee populated by real supporters of children. It has gone beyond partisanship. We are really working together on a common purpose.\n\nWhat we have tried to do is to understand both risk factors for children, but also what are the best developmental pathways; what can we know from the science base about what works and how we can make sure that that knowledge gets across the country. The task for us between now and the budget, should our committee be reconstituted by the all seeing wisdom of the chairman of the human resources development committee, is to focus on the unfinished business.\n\nWe must determine what it is that we can do by way of encouragement and demonstration to show how communities are already doing this and that this is not an abstract reality. There is a huge amount of enthusiasm across Canada for this. The committee can highlight the successes and give us heart so that we may make national what we have been doing so successfully in communities across Canada.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak in the debate on the Speech from the Throne. I am very proud to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people of the Peterborough riding and the city as well as our country. It is a great honour. Each time this occurs it makes me proud. I work hard so that my constituents will be equally proud of me.\n\nThe Speech from the Throne is being described as one which sets out the government's children's agenda. We assume that we are now moving toward a budget based on the Speech from the Throne which is going to be focused on children.\n\nI would like to take a different approach from that of my colleague from Don Valley West who just spoke.\n\nIt is true that there was a huge emphasis on children in the Speech from the Throne. It is also true that this was not sudden. It was not something that was pulled out of a hat. It is something that has been developing. We heard one aspect on the work of the subcommittee of human resources development. It is something that has been going on since the Liberal government was elected in 1993.\n\nI was particularly impressed by something when we began those three years of cuts, those horrific years when all Canadians paid the price of the staggering $42 billion deficit that we inherited from previous governments. One of the things I remember in that first year of the cuts was that in my riding, when money was being taken out of the system in great quantities, new money appeared for prenatal and postnatal care. There was new money to support centres in which parents could learn to nurture their children in the best possible way. Even in those dark years the foundations for this Speech from the Throne and for what I hope will appear in the budget were already being laid.\n\nI have a document which summarizes the Speech from the Throne. I will try to give some of the context for the so-called children's agenda. The context includes the fact that we have to consider parents and families before children are conceived and born. I have mentioned prenatal care and some of those aspects which we have been doing. It is mentioned again in the Speech from the Throne.\n\nThen we have to think of the children themselves, which my colleague was just talking about. My colleague said in great detail that we have to work with the provinces and there are signs that the provinces are going to work with us.\n\nWe are going to make a third investment in the national child benefit. There are now billions of dollars in the national child benefit. These funds go directly to children and their families.\n\nMy only regret is that in Ontario the provincial government chose to take an equivalent amount away from those families on social assistance. For whatever reason, I do not know. It appears to think there is some stigma for families on social assistance. I do not know how children carry stigma so I regret that.\n\nThe national child benefit is helping children and families directly. The government says that there will be further tax relief for children and families.\n\nOn the matter of parental leave, there is a great increase in leave for parents, a doubling of it, which I strongly support. This will help parents, and by that I mean quite literally mothers and fathers, to nurture their children. Parental leave is not for the parents, it is for the children.\n\nIt is my hope that as that provision is brought in there will be very real help, support and advice for smaller businesses that have to adjust to this new regime. I support it strongly but I recognize that tiny businesses have difficulty adjusting to changes of this type. I hope when the time comes to deal with that, there will be help for those small businesses. There are other things as well, such as making the federal government a workplace that is more family friendly.\n\nThose are all for children. We have to think of children before they are born, after they are born and in their very early years as we were discussing. However, we cannot leave it at that. The Speech from the Throne also considers children as they become young adults, youth, teenagers and so on.\n\nIn this agenda there is a program to hire youth to staff the community Internet access sites across the country. There is the launch of exchanges Canada. Every year over 100,000 young Canadians will have a chance to move around the country. Many of us remember Katimavik with great fondness. It is great to think of the children mentioned in this agenda growing up and having this opportunity.\n\nA very interesting program gives younger Canadians from the age of 13 an opportunity to produce their first works using traditional and new technologies in the arts, cultural, digital and similar industries. What a wonderful thing. Then there is a plan to give tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers the opportunity to work in literacy programs.\n\nThere are prenatal children, infants and then youth. Now we go to when children are a little older. The government has already committed to the Canadian education savings grants. They are like RRSPs. Families can buy RESPs. This puts tax-free money aside to support the education of their young people. When they put that money aside, in addition they get a 20% grant up to a value of $2,000. That is already there for children as they are growing up. Families that are looking after their infants can be preparing for their children to go to college or university later on.\n\nThere are a number of other programs of that type, particularly the Canadian millennium scholarship fund. This is a scholarship fund for well qualified but needy students, if that is the right expression, students who need the support. They will be academically good students who need financial support.\n\nWe usually say 100,000 students a year but we tend to forget that the foundation is set up in such a way that it will be 100,000 students a year for 10 years. One million Canadian students. These students are infants now and they will be cared for even better through the children's agenda. One million students will have an opportunity to receive those scholarships to help them get an education so they can lead creative and productive lives.\n\nWe want to go even further than students in college and university. We started with children at the prenatal stage.\n\nThe government in the Speech from the Throne has committed to increasing the funding for the granting councils. Those are the councils which fund social science research, natural science research, medical research. They are the councils which support the arts and so on. Those are the ones which allow our most creative people to fulfil themselves so they can make Canada a much better place. When today's infants grow up, they will be in a much richer society.\n\nI mentioned the Medical Research Council. In the same vein, the Speech from the Throne said that we will table legislation to fund the Canadian institutes for health research. This is going to be an extraordinary development for the Medical Research Council which supports medical research now. It will link the Medical Research Council to research institutes and institutions, to practising hospitals all across the country, to local cancer societies like the one in Peterborough, to community colleges like Sir Sandford Fleming College in Peterborough which have programs to look after the elderly and conduct research. The new Canadian institutes for health research will help every Canadian in the whole country to become healthier.\n\nIt has been a great pleasure for me to speak in this throne speech debate. I look forward to the budget which as we all know is necessary to put these wonderful policies into effect.",

I would have to say that had I been giving a different speech, this is one of the most significant developments not only in research, but in the application of research results in Canada in recent years.\n\nThis is a confederation. The strength of a confederation is that all the different parts of it have a chance to be creative. If one lives in Nova Scotia, one can be creative within the Nova Scotian context. If one lives in Alberta, one can be creative within the Alberta context. In addition, because it is a confederation, one can be creative at the national level. One can take an idea in Nova Scotia or an idea in Quebec and bring it up to the national level and then to the international level.\n\nThe danger of confederation as far as research is concerned is that if we are not careful we will have lots and lots of people all doing their own thing, all reinventing the wheel and so on, without this co-ordination.\n\nThe Canadian institutes for health research will be linked centres all the way across the country that will draw on the expertise of their regions and feed it in to the national scene so that when there is a good idea somewhere it will not be lost. By the way, it will not simply be lost in the morass of information that exists in our world. Nor will it be lost by someone going to the United States or some other jurisdiction. It will capture that idea and bring it forward to the benefit of all Canadians.\n\nThe federal government has always been the main engine of medical research, but there has always been other research. All sorts of hospitals, institutes and organizations are doing research of some sort. The purpose of this new system of Canadian institutes for health is to capture all that creativity to the benefit of all Canadians and, I do not think it is immodest, to the benefit of the health of everyone on the globe. I thank my colleague for her question.",

Even more important, yesterday I was in London, Ontario, for the financial statement and fiscal update of the minister of finance. When I looked through that statement I did not see any reference whatsoever to homelessness. I am wondering whether or not this worries the hon. member.\n\nJust the other night I was walking toward the Congress Centre and there were some 1,400 Liberals at a fundraiser. I think it cost $350 a plate. As I was walking with a certain friend who shall be unidentified, a couple of homeless guys were standing outside asking for money. It just struck me as rather ironic that this friend of mine, a very distinguished member of the House, would be stopped by these two homeless people. They knew who was the Prime Minister. They called out my name and things of that sort. I did not have the heart to tell them that the Prime Minister was having a fundraiser at the Congress Centre, because it cost $350 each to get in.\n\nIt struck me as strange, when we have a $10 billion surplus for this coming fiscal year and around $100 billion accumulating over the next five years, that in the 45 minute speech yesterday by the Minister of Finance there was not even a reference to homelessness.\n\nI am wondering whether the member across the way shares my concern that the Minister of Finance is forgetting about a very important growing social problem, not only in my province but in his as well.",

In Peterborough the federal government funded the forum on homelessness attended by one of my friend's colleagues. That forum and the study associated with it identified the nature of homelessness very seriously in a rural small town environment as distinct from some of the larger urban communities.\n\nHaving identified those problems moneys have started to flow to solve them. For example, there is in Peterborough now a housing resource centre which helps people, young people, older people, and very old people in some cases, search more effectively for a home. The federal government was able to work with the county and the city to deal with that.\n\nEven more recently we had a meeting with representatives of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, one of the federal government's main arms in this regard. Like my colleague I would urge the government to give Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation more resources in the social housing area. Nevertheless, in my riding two weeks ago CMHC was able to fund a substantial project, a refuge for homeless women.\n\nI agree that homelessness is a serious problem.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to start my comments on the throne speech delivered on October 12 in my first language.\n\nThe throne speech is entitled “Building a Higher Quality of Life for All Canadians”. My understanding is that we are trying to provide a better quality of life in the future for our children. A large part of the throne speech is directed to children and the agenda of the government to improve the quality of life of children to ensure they have a good foothold in the new millennium, to ensure they have an economic future, an educational future and are wealthy, healthy Canadians.\n\nI challenge the government not to care only about certain sectors of the population. It should truly live up to its promise that all Canadians will have the same opportunity regardless of where they live.\n\nWe can look at the interconnectedness which the Minister of Industry highlighted. Internet connection will be a major part of Canadian development in a very short time. However, small communities in my riding cannot necessarily make a career or a livelihood by bringing Internet into their homes. We live in the middle of the forest. We live in the middle of abundant resources. This is the direction we should be working toward. We should be training our people to be engineers so that they can make master plans of the resources in those regions.\n\nWhen Canadians were told to wait a month until the House of Commons returned to listen to a throne speech in October we thought of a grand vision. I am trying to make the best of the throne speech. I understand that our children and their journey are a major part of it.\n\nWe must afford our children the wisdom of our elders so that they have the strength of their families and are connected with their communities. Then children can stand with pride knowing who they are and where they are going. They can figure out what is right and what is wrong in life and can go forward with that knowledge.\n\nIn the throne speech a promise was given to a certain group of elders that should be truly recognized, our veterans. As we are close to Remembrance Day I wanted to raise this issue. We talk about merchant marines, the mariners who supplied our troops abroad with many provisions in times of war. These people were not truly recognized in an honourable way and have been asking to be treated equally.\n\nThe other veterans I would like to speak about at this time are aboriginal veterans. Aboriginal veterans in some cases disenfranchised themselves from their treaty status to fight for peace in the world. Upon returning home other veterans were afforded economic development opportunities and land grants, but these grants and opportunities were not given to aboriginal veterans. They were not treated equally. I ask my colleagues in the House on the government side to look at treating aboriginal veterans fairly and equally.\n\nAs a child grows education is crucial in this day and age. There are young pages in the House of Commons who are seeking knowledge and gaining life experiences just by being here. That is what I challenge other youth to do as well. They should leave the schools, move around Canada and experience life elsewhere.\n\nThe throne speech challenges all of us to experience the beauty of Canadian geography, history and people. I challenge people in Quebec to go to Saskatchewan and to the north. I challenge people in British Columbia and the prairies to go to downtown Toronto to see what life is like in a big metropolitan centre. I challenge the Blue Jays to play rubberball with children in La Loche. I challenge the Edmonton Oilers to play street hockey with homeless people in downtown Winnipeg.\n\nWe should enjoy each other's lives and the gifts that we have. Let us not put ourselves on a higher pedestal. We are all Canadians. We all live on the same beautiful land. Just because some people have a different paycheque than others, it does not afford them a different status.\n\nI learned about the economy in grade 12 economics. Money can circulate as many times as it can in one region and afford a certain amount of value. If the Canadian dollar is to retain its value in world markets, we have to circulate the Canadian dollar as many times as we can in Canada before it leaves the country. I also extend this advice to certain regions.\n\nI look at my region and the people of Churchill River. We have very few supermarkets. We have very few butcher shops. We do not have an abundance of hardware stores. All our shopping and our economy are bound to the southern urban centres of Saskatoon, Prince Alberta, North Battleford and Meadow Lake. That is the sad place we are reaching in rural Canada. Farm communities are evaporating as we speak. Credit unions, schools and hospitals have been dismantled because the community no longer functions. That is the sad fact in rural and regional Canada.\n\nThe urban centres cannot demand all the economy and strength of the country. We have to share from coast to coast to coast. We cannot all be Torontonians, Montrealers, or people of Regina and Vancouver. It is not the dream of all Canadians to live in a huge city in suburban Canada. I ask members to imagine living in the north, living in the wilderness. Maybe with a satellite dish they could make billion dollar deals right there with e-commerce, as the industry minister said. One does not have to be in a city to do this. It could be done from one's home in Pierceland, La Ronge or Cold Lake.\n\nI challenge Canadians to treat each other with respect. I have seen an abundance of ill feelings among certain sectors and peoples in the country which just does not flow with the Canadian vision. We have founded a nation where people from all over the world have found a home. I say a home because that is basically what we are talking about. The House of Commons is a home for Canada.\n\nWe must not forget that for generations aboriginal people have held this country and land together, living in harmony with its nature and its unique gifts and challenges in a respectful way. That is the challenge I extend to everyone. Let us live in that essence into the new millennium. Let us live together. Let us welcome people who find refuge here perhaps because of hard times in other parts of the world. We have a lot to offer. Let us not point them to the urban slums of our country. Let us share the beauty of our villages, hamlets and little settlements of 15 people that are so proud.\n\nIn my riding there is a community that built its own school out of logs. One could not see a prouder student attending a school than those whose school was built by their aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers.\n\nNow we have the vision that a technologically innovative future is a school that is interconnected. Could one of our grandparents connect a computer? No. It is our 12 and 15 year olds that connect the Apples and IBMs together, but we still have to put the two generations together. They cannot travel on different journeys. We have to envision them living in harmony together.\n\nThis opportunity to speak gives me the opportunity to thank the people I represent. As I mentioned, this seat belongs to the people of Churchill River. They are the ones who empower me to say these words. That is the story I wish to tell.\n\nI come from a region that is called a boreal forest. It is basically in the middle of the bush.\n\nThese are the people of the woods.\n\nAll the highways in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Manitoba go north and south. The infrastructure is not the same in the north. The north is basically a colony to the south. Canadians have to stop treating the north like a food supply, a wood supply and a mineral supply. We have also at one time provided Britain with all the furs they needed. All the beavers which came from the north were sent over there. We cannot do that anymore. We must be given due respect. We make our living in the north and envision our people and our children growing up in the north and sharing with the rest of the world. It cannot be done without us.\n\nThere is no master plan for infrastructure in northern development. We see logging roads and mining roads but when are the communities going to be connected? When are the dots going to be connected to the northern villages? We used to travel along the river east and west, but our highways are all north and south. These roads do not connect our communities at all.\n\nFor many years we have had major discussions on national parks. I have one in my riding. I believe six future parks are being committed for ecological integrity, national identity and for preservation and conservation. These parks are targeted for the boreal forest. However, we have to talk with the community members, the people who make their living off the land. These people cannot be relocated.\n\nCMHC has brought in housing programs to urbanize northerners. Northern trappers and hunters have never been agrarian people. We have never lived in a commune for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We were hunters and gatherers who went 30, 40 or 100 miles to get the goods and bring them back to our families. These people moved around. The expanse is huge. It is not like an agrarian centre where the farmers stayed in one central area. The hunter-gatherer society was a a totally different concept. We cannot impose an agrarian principle on a hunter-gatherer. Going into the bush is like going into a new world. Welcome it because it is a beautiful place.\n\nWe see the head offices of industrial and corporate developments in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver but they have no presence in the north. They have to leave legacies. I challenge institutions such as universities, research centres and hospitals. I challenge anyone in the House to identify anything that the Hudson's Bay Company has left in our northern villages. Not one swing, not one slide and not one hospital bed has been left by the Hudson's Bay Company in any of our northern communities. That is a shame. That is not what corporate consciousness should be like here in Canada or in the world.\n\nI challenge the federal government to take leadership in northern development. We have a department called Indian Affairs and Northern Development that has been comfortable with identifying north of 60 as the north. The north is not north of 60. It is further south than that. The 55th parallel or even the 53rd or 52nd parallel in some of our provinces is truly defined as the northern half of our provinces.\n\nI want to touch on the agricultural crisis that is growing and offer my perspective on this whole process. The throne speech was very remiss in not identifying the farm income crisis. The whole industrialization of the agricultural industry has taken its toll on the independent farmer. It is beyond many of the factors that have come into play. There are multinational interests.\n\nThere are four or five multinational companies that control the food and drug industry in the world. They are not in this debate. We have farm aid, which I just recently acknowledged. Country music is near and dear to many people in the country. Willie Nelson throws a major farm aid benefit in the U.S. The non-profit farm aid corporation identifies its concerns with the multinational interests in farming. They say that no matter how much money or how much aid the farmers get, unless the corporations ease up on the input and output costs of the farm, it is the same corporations controlling both ends. They basically have the farmers in the middle, in the crunch.\n\nThe whole issue of floods, droughts and the extreme conditions we are getting from climate change will have an impact on the agricultural industry for years to come. It is not only a short term problem, it will be a very long term issue.\n\nIn one of my local papers I was bold enough to raise the idea that maybe a royal commission should be commissioned to report on the family farm in order to protect it. Let us document 1999 and the year 2000. Let us show our children in documented form how the evolution of the farm came to be in Canada, where it should be going, what the factors are and who had their hands in the farm industry and economy.\n\nFarmers only get mere cents. I understand that because in my riding there wild rice farmers, ranchers and trappers. I come from a generation of trappers and hunters. When the fur industry fell down nobody helped us. We had to look at ourselves and where we were going. The fur industry is still there.\n\nThe people just love living off the land. There is pride living off the land and being able to provide one's family with the food and shelter they need. A lot of our urbanized people who had lost touch with the land have regained a whole new connection with respect to the beauty of it.\n\nMy father still goes out on the land, as did my grandparents before that. That is the connectedness that we have to give our children for the future, as well. Let us not remove them and put them all in an urban centre.\n\nThe throne speech contains grand promises for children, health and the environment. We have the economy, diversity, technological change and all these exchanges being promised in the throne speech. The challenge now for Canadians is to push the government to make good on its promises. We have to make sure that the surpluses are spent right, that they are not going only into political strongholds or pockets. We have to make sure that all Canadians benefit.\n\nI am here to bring a message, on behalf of the people in the constituency I represent, that we are in northern Canada. The people in Churchill River consider themselves as northerners. We cannot be brushed off as “those people from the west”. We are living in western Canada but we live in the northern region, in the northern climate of the country. It is a whole new and different economy with a new and different social community. When mining and timber industries make plans for one's backyard, it does have an effect on the north but does not affect the social or economic well-being in the country.\n\nOn behalf of our people, I beg for a change in the freshwater fish marketing industry that I spoke about earlier. The government is deregulating airlines, railroads, power utilities, telephone utilities and everything else.\n\nWe have a freshwater fish marketing that does not even allow our people to sell across the border. The people in the community of Pierceland, just a stone's throw away from the Alberta border, cannot even sell their pickerel to Cold Lake which is just across the border. They have to sell it all the way down in Winnipeg which is one big fishing plant. By then the fish is not fresh anymore. It is old, frozen fish by the time it leaves that plant.\n\nAnyone wanting to buy fresh fish should come to the northern lakes and buy it right off our docks. We will fillet it, dry it, even smoke it and ship it. Maybe we can use e-commerce to make us economically viable as world traders. The deregulation of the freshwater fish industry has to happen. It is a far cry today from what it actually intended to be 30 years ago. I think a lot of northern fishers were blindsided by the promises of the federal government.\n\nI congratulate the government for making bold promises, but we, as Canadians, are here to say that we have to go through with our promises, especially when we are dealing with the future of children. If it is a children's agenda, let us not sway from the promises being made. We will hold the government true to that.",

It is seldom that we see people get up in the House and speak from their hearts as this man obviously did. When we speak from the heart we put all our political stripes aside. We have to admire a person for being able to do that when we know that he truly means it and that it is not some canned speech that has been written for him by some other group. I appreciate that.\n\nLet us get back to the throne speech and the title, “A Better Quality of Life”. The member may know that I spent some time in the Indian affairs department as one of the critics. My mission was going across the country and visiting as many reserves as I possibly could, which ended up being several hundred, and visiting with grassroots people. I did not visit with the elite. I did not visit with chiefs and council. I talked to people face to face and tried to see the problems from their point of view.\n\nI will give the member one example of the reserve in my riding. It is in the most beautiful spot one could ever ask for in Alberta. It borders the grand Banff National Park. It is a huge reserve with a tremendous amount of agricultural land and many hills and trees. It has a river running through it and a huge lake where a lot of people gather for skiing, boating and things of that nature. Highway 1, a major interprovincial highway, runs through the reserve. Approximately 10 million people drive through this reserve on an annual basis as they head for Banff National Park.\n\nHowever, on this reserve the unemployment rate is 90%. The debt load is huge. Approximately 16% of children who start their education complete it by grade 12. Most of them are in schools outside of the reserve. Poverty is at its greatest. In the member's view, what kind of quality of life does the throne speech promise for the people who are suffering on many of these reserves?",

It is a gift from the Creator. In order to speak from the heart, as I did in my speech today, I had to open with my language. That is how I opened the door to share that with the House.\n\nThe member highlighted one reserve in his question and wanted to know what the throne speech had to offer. The throne speech aside, the relationship between aboriginal communities, mine included, and the rest of Canada is a major challenge that started 500 years ago. The challenge is whether we can live with each other's laws.\n\nI say each other because we have grown accustomed to and have lived under the British North America Act and the laws that came through Britain and this House for all of Canada. However, can Canadians who came to this continent live with the aboriginal laws and policies? That is where the empowerment is.\n\nAboriginal people could see that giving up a way of life and allowing other people to live on their land was a major investment. However, if those people can build their houses, build their roads, teach their children, preserve their language and make their people healthy, then they will feel a sense of pride that will take them and ignite them and keep the cycle of life going.\n\nIt is not a linear journey; it is a cycle. We only serve one cycle. So when aboriginal people are given an opportunity to prove to their community that they can achieve something in a respectful way, that is the investment that will take us into the next generations.\n\nWith respect to the throne speech, I said that I would not get political in my speech, so I cannot slam anybody for not having anything in there. What we have to do in the relationships we have in the new millennium, among our communities, is to live with each other and respect each other's laws and ways of life. That will take us forever.",

That creates a lot of problems. One of the existing rural problems is the farm crisis in western Canada. It is very difficult to convince the people who live in urban surroundings that the problem is real. It is much like the situation faced by constituents of Churchill River, who live in the northern part of Saskatchewan, which is different from the southern, rural, agricultural based economy. We can see why there are so many difficulties encountered, certainly in the House, in getting the message through to the government.\n\nIt is much like the problems of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board, which exists in my constituency. Not only is my riding agricultural, but because we have freshwater lakes we also have fishermen. The problems of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board in determining where fish can be sold can be compared to the farmers who face restrictions and penalties under the Canadian Wheat Board.\n\nWe have a lot of problems. If we are really going to look at a new way of governing the people of this country we have to look at new vehicles and measures.\n\nDoes the member have any ideas on how we can get rid of institutions like the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board and the Canadian Wheat Board, or at least make them more flexible so they meet the needs of the people they are supposed to serve?",

We cannot wait for fish to go to market. Wheat and other grains can wait. We see silos and holding elevators all over the prairie provinces. These containers can hold their grains for months on end, but we cannot hold fish. It has to be fresh.\n\nThe most delicate fish is pickerel. It is the best fish to be eaten, right out of the lake, into the frying pan. If we buy it in markets it is drowned fish. My uncle, who is a professional fisherman, tells us that.\n\nFresh fish is not governed by the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board. That is frozen fish. It is like McCain's fish and chips in the store. That is not the nutritional fish that comes from our lakes.\n\nWe cannot compare the Canadian Wheat Board to the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board. That is all I can say. There is no comparison. The federal control that the hon. member was referring to is a whole different thing. When we talk about freshwater fish, let us keep it fresh. Let us sell it as directly as we can to the markets. Let us bring the processing plants back to those little communities. The processing jobs, the jobs of the people who fileted the fish, who gutted the fish in our little plants, all went to Transcona.

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is truly an honour for me to speak today on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. Before I begin, however, I would like to give a bit of an explanation of the context of the aspect of the speech on which I am going to concentrate: the chairs of excellence.\n\nIn my riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine there is a university. It is the Loyola Campus of Concordia University. On the Island of Montreal we have four major universities.\n\nThere is the Université de Montréal, McGill, the two campuses of Concordia, and the Université du Québec à Montréal. I have had the honour and the privilege of studying at three of these: Concordia, McGill and UQAM.\n\nSo, when the representatives of the universities came to see me after the 1997 election to tell me of their need for more money for the research councils, funding for innovation, for infrastructure, and for the researchers themselves, I was very pleased to be able to support their approaches to the government for this funding.\n\nAs we all know, in previous budgets the Canadian government announced the creation of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation with a $1 billion endowment fund. The foundation was to create the physical infrastructure which the universities, institutes of research and the councils require. However, we need the people. We need the researchers.\n\nWe have been hearing a lot about the brain drain. One thing is clear. There has been a certain amount of brain drain in terms of our qualified researchers and our young graduates who, because of the lack of opportunities here, have been lured away to universities in the United States and elsewhere to undertake important research activities.\n\nIt was a great pleasure for me to learn that our government, through its throne speech, took on the challenge. By doing so it has started a bold venture that will be one of the cornerstones of our effort as a government to ensure that Canada is the place to be, the place to live, the place that people want to come to and the place where people want to stay in the third millennium to take full advantage of the knowledge based society and economy of the 21st century.\n\nWhat is that bold venture? That bold venture is the creation of the 21st century chairs for research excellence. The government announced in its throne speech that through the research granting councils, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Medical Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, it will be funding the creation of 1,200 new 21st century chairs for research excellence in Canadian universities over the next three years.\n\nThat is a major investment. We can be assured that our Canadian universities have received the information on this new project with great joy and happiness.\n\nWe will be investing in the first year $60 million, in the second year $120 million and in the third year and every subsequent year $180 million.\n\nOne of the objectives is not simply to rest on our laurels with 1,200 chairs, it is ultimately to bring that number up to 2,000 chairs of research excellence in the third millennium.\n\nWhat are these chairs of excellence going to do? They are going to be two tiered. One will be to attract our established star researchers who already have a proven record in their field of conducting leading research endeavours. The second tier will be to attract our rising stars. We have been losing on both fronts over the last years. Everyone knows that the government in its fight to eliminate the deficit had to reduce funding to the research councils. That obviously had a boomerang effect. It meant that there was less money for researchers. Therefore, researchers who wanted to continue conducting their work in some cases had to look elsewhere.\n\nBy creating these 1,200 chairs of research excellence, and hopefully bringing them up to 2,000, we will be able to keep our proven star researchers and attract the rising stars. All Canadian universities will be able to participate.\n\nTo receive funding the universities will submit proposals to a competitive peer review process which will be administered by the three granting councils.\n\nThis program sends a strong message, a strong signal that Canada is the place to be for research and development in the third millennium, that Canada is serious about fostering and nurturing a healthy research environment in Canada and that we are serious about nurturing and fostering a strong economy through knowledge and innovation.\n\nThis is what we call added value. The Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the expansion of the networks of centres of excellence and the development of the Canadian institutes of health research that the hon. member for Peterborough spoke about at great length are the cornerstones that will ensure that Canada will be the place to be for research and innovation in the third millennium. Our renewed and increased funding to the granting councils is the added value, along with the 21st century chairs of research excellence.\n\nI am not an innovative person, so I have a difficult time imagining what else we can do. However, I am sure that with all of the bright minds in the House we will get many suggestions on what we can do to ensure that we are the place to be.\n\nBy creating these 1,200 chairs of research excellence we will have the best people doing research in Canada, which will create our next generation of the world's best. The world's best will be here in Canada. Our young researchers will seek out the top opportunities for work and they will choose Canada, both our young researchers in Canada as well as those from elsewhere. Graduate students will be looking for leaders, proven stars in research, to assist them in their research projects. Because there will be the first tier for the star researchers with a proven track record, they will want to come to our Canadian universities to complete their graduate and post-graduate studies.\n\nThe program for the 21st century chairs for research excellence builds on the comprehensive strategy to boost innovation that this Liberal government has been implementing over the last three years. As I mentioned, that includes a $1 billion endowment for the Canada foundation for innovation, the expansion of the networks of centres of excellence, the Canadian institutes for health research with $500 million over three years and the renewal of funding to our granting councils.",

The number of people for instance going to the U.S. from Canada has grown from 17,000 to about 86,000 in I believe the last 12 years. It is very, very important. The fact is that Nortel is losing 300 to 400 software engineers per year to the U.S. This is very, very important.\n\nThe hon. member seems to believe with some level of 1970s Liberal economic naivete that all this can be solved with government intervention. This is despite the fact that most of the companies that are affected are pointing to the tax system as having a significant and deleterious impact on our ability to keep people here.\n\nThere are three areas that are raised most frequently by the high tech sector. The capital gains tax system is effectively twice as oppressive in Canada than in the U.S. That affects those in the high tech sector because of stock options. Also, our top marginal tax rate kicks in at $60,000 in Canada. The equivalent top marginal tax threshold in the U.S. does not occur until $420,000 Canadian.\n\nI would suggest that some of those stars we are trying to keep are probably in that over $60,000 tax level, so it is very important that we address those issues.

Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that our personal income taxes are higher, approximately 10% I believe it is. He may correct me on that. However, it is also known that our payroll taxes are much lower than those of most of the countries in the G-7, including the United States if I am not mistaken. I may be corrected if I am mistaken.\n\nIt has already been announced. The Minister of Finance already discussed the economic outlook for the next couple of years.

That is where the 10% comes in. It has come out to approximately 10% lower income taxes paid by the average Canadian. There has been a steady decrease in personal income taxes.\n\nIn the last budget we removed the 3% surtax which the Progressive Conservative Party established when it formed the government. That in itself is a major impact. We will be reducing taxes. However, we will not do anything which will put into peril the health of our economy and put us back into a deficit position.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise in the House today to participate in the throne speech debate.\n\nFirst I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Her Excellency our new Governor General on her historic appointment. I wish her nothing but the very best of luck in the years ahead with her new and important responsibilities.\n\nThe government's throne speech is a blueprint which lays the foundation for the government's plans in the years to come. As we approach the new millennium, there is an unprecedented optimism in Canada's future which is captured in the eloquence of the throne speech. What an unbelievable change from just a few short years ago.\n\nIn 1993, the last year of the Conservative government, Canada's fiscal house was crumbling on its very foundation. The previous Conservative government let the debt skyrocket out of control for years and was operating with a $42 billion deficit. The country was literally teetering on the brink of financial disaster. Liberals understood that if Canada was to be a global force to be reckoned with in the new millennium, we absolutely had to get this country back on track. Canada needed bold leadership, sound fiscal policy and unparalleled political courage to restore our national future.\n\nSix years later, we have delivered. Canada has moved from red ink to black ink, from pessimism to pride. In four short years we eliminated the deficit and recorded a budgetary surplus of $3.5 billion in 1998, the first surplus in 28 years. We have regained the capacity to make choices of how we build the future. We are now positioned to be a leader in the new and ever changing global arena.\n\nThis throne speech for the millennium builds upon our original and balanced and comprehensive plan. We are committed to staying the course in an effort to improve the lives of each and every Canadian. Our plan includes developing our children and youth, leaders for the 21st century; enhancing our dynamic economy; strengthening the quality of our health care; ensuring the quality of the environment; building stronger communities; and advancing Canada's place in the world.\n\nIn the new global economy, knowledge and technological innovation are the cornerstones of a higher standard of living and a better quality of life. This government is committed to Canada's role as a global leader in high technology. This is very good news, especially for my constituency.\n\nMy riding of Nepean—Carleton is situated in the hub of Canada's fastest growing region of high technology firms, Silicon Valley North, as it has become known. This region is responsible for 75% of Canada's telecommunications research and development. It boasts almost 1,000 advanced technology companies that employ more than 48,000 people.\n\nFrom rather humble beginnings with agencies like the National Research Council and the Communications Research Establishment to companies like Bell Northern and Computing Devices, small companies have grown into large companies. These companies in turn have spawned other companies featuring new products and new technology. This cycle continues to create jobs and prosperity and export dollars for Canada.\n\nIt is vital that the government remains committed to promoting Canada's role as a leader in new technologies. Month by month the government's policies aimed at growth in this sector of the economy continue to bear fruit.\n\nYesterday, Nortel Networks announced that it plans to invest $330 million in Canada to enhance its booming optical networking business, tripling overall production capacity by next year. Montreal and Ottawa are the greatest beneficiaries of this major capital infusion. New high tech facilities will be constructed in both cities with approximately 2,300 new jobs shared between the two. In total, Nortel expects to invest $210 million in Ottawa and an additional $120 million in Montreal.\n\nJust last July, JDS Uniphase, which employs close to 2,400 workers in my riding, unveiled its new 500,000 square foot research facility in Nepean.\n\nBoth announcements and the scores of others we hear on a regular basis from this industry are indicative of the high level of confidence in Canada's high technology future and the future of the Ottawa area as Silicon Valley North. This is a clear sign that globally renowned companies on the cutting edge of the new information technologies recognize that Canada is indeed the place to be in the 21st century.\n\nI will say a few words about the finance minister's fiscal update which he delivered yesterday. It is clearly a fundamental and integral component of the government's plans for the years ahead as expressed in the throne speech.\n\nProfound congratulations are in order for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday he delivered an economic statement that can only be described as extraordinary. He has done an absolutely superb job. Together, the throne speech and the economic and fiscal update are a one-two punch for Canada that moves us into a class by ourselves. Together these two documents show tremendous leadership and vision by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.\n\nThe Minister of Finance's economic statement is consistent with what the government has said all along, that the Canadian economy is very strong and our finances are very sound. Unemployment is at a decade-long low. Interest rates and inflation are both under control. The forecast of unprecedented budget surpluses over the next five years is staggering.\n\nI applaud the finance minister's pledge to keep an open and transparent budget planning process. The more Canadians know about and have input into our economic situation, the better the government can work to the benefit of all Canadians.\n\nI wish to express my unqualified support for the fact that the government is refusing to be complacent about fiscal responsibility. The openness and care with which the contingency reserve funds are to be handled and the commitment to never fund tax relief with borrowed dollars are vitally important. I am sure this is a great comfort to Canadians.\n\nLet me talk about our future prosperity, the foundation for which has been laid by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the government.\n\nFirst and most crucial, yesterday's economic and fiscal update made it abundantly clear that skills, knowledge and building a more innovative economy remain the critical investment priorities of this government. Beginning at the earliest stages of development right through to post-secondary education and beyond, the government's plan for the future displays a lifetime commitment to our children for their lifetime.\n\nI speak of the extension of parental EI benefits, of the $7 billion national child benefit system, of the $1.2 billion Canadian opportunities strategy, and of the Canada education savings grant, as merely the beginning of the initiatives which the government will take on.\n\nThe investment in Canadian prosperity does not stop there. It is well acknowledged that the societies which will thrive over the next decade not just economically but in all aspects are those societies which excel at innovation. We must foster an economic environment which will make our brightest minds want to stay and innovate in Canada.\n\nThe proposed multi-year program for sustained and broad based tax relief is a fundamental component of our economic and fiscal plans. The underlying philosophy of the government's approach to tax cuts were conveyed in yesterday's economic statement.\n\nI quote the Minister of Finance directly: “There are many reasons for reducing taxes. However, there is one I would like to mention because it is too frequently overlooked. It is quite simply that Canadians are entitled to keep more of the money they earn. After all, they worked for it. It is theirs”. Those are the words of our finance minister, a true tax cutter.\n\nThe reduction of employment insurance premiums for the sixth consecutive year will also put a further $1.2 billion into the pockets of Canadians. The determination of the government to make our business tax system internationally competitive will keep jobs, and of equal importance, brain power, innovation and excellence in Canada where they belong.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to say a few words concerning how the throne speech relates to Canada's place in the world. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Canadians want their government to play an active, independent and internationalist role in the world.\n\nWhat are our responsibilities as one of the most peaceful and prosperous countries on the face of the planet? There is an old saying that to whom much has been given much is expected. The world has the right to expect a lot from Canada through our involvement in the global community and we must not let it down.\n\nWe have made and continue to make significant contributions to peacekeeping and international development. With Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor, just to mention some of the more significant deployments, we have the largest contingent of Canadians abroad since the Korean war. With the recent announcements of more funds for international development assistance, combined with our peacekeeping, Canada is doing its share, but there is still much to do.\n\nOur foreign minister's human security agenda which seeks to enhance the safety of civilians in armed conflicts is in my view one of the most important foreign policy initiatives to come out of this country in decades. While we have made progress on the land mines issue and the International Court of Justice, the challenges ahead are immense.\n\nTo sum up, this is a throne speech that exudes confidence in Canada, our economic and social future, as well as our privileged place in the family of nations. It is a throne speech that speaks to our achievements and looks ahead to the challenges and great opportunities that Canada faces in the 21st century.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I feel that the hon. member opposite has misinterpreted or misunderstood the human development index.\n\nI took the opportunity just shortly after the index was released and the announcement made to go to the United Nations website and print out a huge document covering all aspects of the human development index. The place that Canada occupies in the human development index is based on a wide range of factors which takes into account things like life expectancy, education and quality of health care. There are an enormous number of criteria contained in that index. As a result of taking into account all the criteria, Canada ranks number one in the world. It is extraordinary that we have been in that place for the last six years.\n\nThat is not to say that in certain areas we cannot do better. Clearly, as it relates to our aboriginal population, we must do better. Some initiatives the government has taken, and I am thinking specifically with respect to the Nisga'a treaty, lay the foundation for prosperity for our aboriginal peoples. It points the way in terms of the self-government process which the government has adopted of allowing native Canadians to run their own affairs and to have some control over their future. As bad as things may be for our native population according to the hon. member, things have to be kept in perspective with respect to how other parts of the world live.\n\nI know the Reform Party has never been very keen on international development, but I had the opportunity to represent this country as a special envoy to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is ranked last of 174 nations under the human development index. Having seen the conditions in which the people in that country live, I wish in some respects that many Canadians would have the opportunity to go to places like that so they could see how the poorest of the poor live. I am sure they would probably feel as I did. They would want to come back to this country and kiss the very ground we walk on.\n\nWe are blessed in this country. We are prosperous. Our country is peaceful compared to many other places in the world. We have an obligation not just to help native Canadians and aboriginal Canadians but to help other people in the world through our international development assistance programs.\n\nWe have a responsibility to assist others who are in need. The government takes that responsibility very seriously. I am absolutely delighted that our government has taken the opportunity of the throne speech to announce more funds for international development because I think Canada does have a responsibility. We are doing a great deal but we can always do more.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I will share my time with the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.\n\nOn behalf of my constituents in the riding of Compton—Stanstead, I am pleased to speak to the Speech from the Throne. I congratulate the new Governor General, Adrienne Clarkson, on her new challenge, which, I am sure, she will meet with dignity and wisdom.\n\nI would like to say a few words on several matters not included in the throne speech, inadvertently no doubt. I realize that, in the throne speech, no one expects all the details, but it should at least contain an outline of all the areas of government responsibility.\n\nI have to mention two items that were not addressed in the throne speech. The first was national defence. There was one line at the end of the speech which basically said nothing. I will quote it:\n\nThe Government will also continue to ensure that Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canada's role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign land.\n\nThe first line is interesting. I think we all know a lot better than that. We have a national defence system that is dying of equipment rust out. Yes, we do have a few pieces of state of the art equipment but we are lacking in 90% of our equipment.\n\nGovernments around the world all know and say that national defence planning is long term. In 1994 we put forth a white paper with a long term affordable plan. This plan has now been put by the wayside. If the standing committee had not concentrated on the quality of life of our soldiers, they would still be living below the poverty line. Imagine working poor in our military.\n\nI congratulate the Minister of National Defence for supporting the SCONDVA in the quality of life report to date. I hope he will continue to do so. There will be reports coming to the House giving us the heads up on quality of life issues, but I only wish the minister would follow through on the 1994 white paper.\n\nThe 1994 white paper is this government's document. I would understand if it were from a previous government that it would not honour such a paper. We do see this a lot. This is a plan to which all parties agreed. It is not a grandiose plan. It is a plan to get our military back on its feet and to give our soldiers a better working chance to do their job with safe and modern equipment. Our military is stretched to its limit in both manpower and equipment. We cannot even work under our own flag when we take up peacekeeping duties throughout the world.\n\nLet us look at all the peacekeeping locations in which we are working under another country. Small groups all over the world cost far more than having one brigade group under our own flag with proper rotation so that all our soldiers can get proper rest and family time. This is a high stress job. Many of the problems we see in our military are caused from this stress. Regular rotation and rest would reduce many of the physical and mental problems. I could go on with many more details but there is a lack of time.\n\nI would also like to discuss another subject which I did not see addressed in the throne speech, immigration. I do not think anyone would argue against the fact that our immigration system is broken. This was evident this summer with the west coast migrant problem. This is but the tip of the iceberg. The 600 refugee claimants on the west coast represent only 2% of our annual total.\n\nThe former minister had promised a new bill on immigration for October 1999. Today is November 3, and from what I can see, this new bill is not on the agenda of the House or the standing committee.\n\nThe problem of illegal refugees is very easy to understand. It is a lot easier and quicker to enter Canada this way even if the practice is illegal and very dangerous for those who choose it.\n\nThe Canadian Trucking Association urgently needs 5,000 employees that it cannot recruit in Canada. However, our immigration system is slow to react. Two-year delays are unreasonable and unacceptable, particularly when there is a lack of knowledge about the qualifications required. For instance, seeing a doctor or an accountant delivering pizza or driving a taxi, seems ridiculous to me.\n\nI want to describe a typical case seen by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, another department that stands out, unfortunately, for its inefficiency.\n\nIn June 1998, one of my constituents applied to the embassy in the Republic of Ghana for permanent residence for his wife, who was seven months pregnant. The same month, approval was received from the provincial and federal governments. It seems very, very simple. Several months passed and the only information the woman received about her application was that she would be called to an interview at some point in time. She would then be asked to undergo a medical examination.\n\nOn February 8, 1999, in other words several months later, her husband came to my riding office to ask me to try to find out what I could about his file.\n\nThe woman gave birth on January 8, 1999. An initial e-mail was immediately sent to the embassy, requesting that I be told where the file was at. There was no reply. On February 16, 1999, the man got in touch with his wife, who said that the interview was to take place in March 1999 or as soon as an officer went to Bamako. Depending on how the interview went, an medical examination would follow.\n\nOn April 1, 1999, another e-mail went out from my riding office to the embassy. Once again, there was no reply. On April 6, 1999, my office send a new e-mail, and again on April 13.\n\nFinally, on April 15, I receive a reply which reads as follows: “The following is in response to your message of April 13, 1999. The woman will have to be interviewed before a decision can be made. We were unable to reach her on time during our last trip to Bamako, in March. We therefore put her name back on the waiting list for our next trip, the date of which has yet to be determined”. “However, if she can make the trip to Abidjan, she could be interviewed quickly, that is within a week's notice. If the applicant and the assisting relative choose that option, let me know so that arrangements can be made accordingly”.\n\nI therefore informed my constituent and I gave notice of the option chosen by this woman, who will travel to Abidjan. On April 27, 1999, the woman showed up for her interview in Abidjan. On May 19, she underwent her medical examination. She was declared healthy and now simply had to wait for her visa. On July 5, 1999, my constituent came to see me again and told me that he has not heard anything about his wife's visa since May.\n\nThat same day, an e-mail was sent to the embassy, asking for information about the wife's visa. On July 6, the embassy replied that the husband's divorce certificate was required.\n\nIs it not odd that a whole year had passed before the immigration adviser realized this document was missing from the file? Yet at the interview the wife was never informed of the obligation to provide this document.\n\nOn July 9, the husband's divorce certificate was faxed to the embassy and my constituent has proof that it was sent. On July 16, 1999, I again e-mailed the embassy, asking for confirmation that the certificate had been received. On August 2, I sent another e-mail to the embassy. I have still not received an answer.\n\nOn August 17, I still had heard nothing from the embassy. I sent another e-mail on August 27. What is going on? Canada's embassies are understaffed.",

This is clearly a very difficult circumstance for the people actually involved.\n\nWe deal with 210 or 212 countries on a regular basis in terms of immigration. It is an extraordinary thing.\n\nI, for example, live in a riding which does not consider itself particularly “ethnic” and yet I represent between 60 and 70 first generation nationalities. I know there are colleagues on this side from the great cities of Canada who also represent 200 different first generation Canadians. I mention that to the member, not as an excuse, but as a fact. It is very complex out there and our embassies struggle with a variety of people.\n\nBy the way, when I say 210 to 212, if we are dealing with a country like India they may well be dealing with not just five or six official languages but with hundreds of other languages. There are difficulties and I know my colleague is aware of them.\n\nI, like the member, work as hard as I can on immigration cases. Does he, as a member of parliament, ever consider dealing with people in the department here in Canada? I know e-mail is a wonderful thing, but when it gets complicated and has gone on for 12 months, does he ever pick up the phone and deal directly with the embassies?

As I mentioned at the outset, this is just one of many cases. I live in an area with a very low ethnic population but I deal with cases like this on a very regular basis. I think the biggest problem is a lack of people in our embassies to do the work. We also know there has been a huge cut in the number of people.\n\nIn reference to what this has to do with the Speech from the Throne, I mentioned of course the armed forces which was very lightly gone over in the Speech from the Throne, but immigration was not mentioned at all.\n\nThe Speech from the Throne is supposed to set out the priorities of the government in general terms. I said at the outset that we were not expecting to see details. We are looking at the generalities. Everything should be covered in the Speech from the Throne. There was nothing about immigration, in particular since immigration has been one of the top problems today.\n\nThe case I brought forward is not a refugee problem. It is the problem of getting a family back together, something that is supposed to have a very high priority. At the end of the file the lady finally received her visa a couple of weeks ago after a year and a half. She was pregnant when she applied. In that time period she had the baby. Her husband has had the opportunity to go there but it is very expensive to run back and forth. It seems so unfair when we are trying to get families together that we are not doing it.\n\nThere should have been a reference in the Speech from the Throne stating that we should be doing something about immigration. The minister promised to bring forward a bill in October. It is now November. When we look at the agenda there is nothing there. There is nothing happening in committee. The bill is not coming forward. That is what I am talking about.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, today I am talking about what was not in the throne speech. That is what we have to look at. There were a lot of areas not covered and what was in the speech was vague, anyway.\n\nThere was no vision in the throne speech for the unemployed who are dependent on social assistance. There was no vision for our youth. The throne speech made absolutely no reference to an increase in transfer payments to the provinces that administer those programs.\n\nThere was mention of children. However the day after the throne speech there were as many hungry children as the day before. I am not sure that there was a lot in the speech for children.\n\nTransfer payments have been slashed by billions of dollars since the arrival of the Liberal government, actually $11 billion.\n\nThat is a lot of money. If they think that problems can be solved by cutting back programs, they are mistaken. If they continue to take money from the provinces administering these programs, our children will keep on going to school hungry, and they will keep on saying “I cannot afford to stay in school past Grade 12”. This is not acceptable, especially in a rich country like Canada.\n\nWhat have these cuts caused in our communities? Since 1993 we have 500,000 more poor children in this very rich country. This means more children are going to school hungry.\n\nI must take this opportunity to commend Premier Bernard Lord for initiating and putting in place a breakfast program in our schools, a program very much needed since the arrival of the Liberal government in 1993.\n\nIn New Brunswick during the Liberal regime of the McKenna and Thériault governments they slashed over 600 hospital worker jobs during their 10 year reign in New Brunswick. With only three months in power Premier Lord announced 300 new jobs in our health care system. Again I commend him. It shows that if we want to we can. Premier Lord is dealing with the same amount of money that Camille Thériault and Frank McKenna were dealing with, but what they were doing was slashing. It seems to be a habit of theirs as it is in Ottawa.\n\nFor our young men and women wanting to further their education after high school there was certainly no vision in the throne speech. To be $50,000 in debt after four to six years of university is certainly unacceptable. The children of our rich country should be given a real chance to be prepared and ready to lead our country in the future. A $50,000 debt is an obstacle that must be addressed. It can be addressed by the Liberal government increasing transfer payments to the provinces.\n\nWe have to look at the reality of things. I often hear young people say “I will not be going on after grade 12. It is too expensive and there are no jobs. I have to move here, I have to move there, I have to go to the U.S.”.\n\nOur young people do not have a vision of the future. They must be shown that they can find work in their province and that they can have post-secondary education. Our young people can contribute to their community, but they will not do so by leaving the regions.\n\nClearly the decisions made here in Ottawa targeted the Atlantic region. We have seen what that meant in federal elections: the number of Liberal members dropped from 31 to 11 here in Ottawa. Clearly, the decisions made targeted the Atlantic regions.\n\nAnother reason for the greater number of poor in our country is the cuts to the employment insurance program. No one here can say otherwise. It is clear that there is more poverty.\n\nIn the throne speech there is no mention of the negative impact felt by seasonal workers in this country. Seasonal workers are everywhere in this country. They are not only in the Atlantic regions. They exist throughout the country. They depend on the seasons and not on employment insurance.\n\nThat is very important. People have to realize that seasonal workers are not dependent on the employment insurance program. They are dependent on the seasons. If we could have summer for eight months of the year in New Brunswick, believe me, we would take it. People would work during that season. If it were a tourist season of eight months, be assured that people would be working.\n\nWe have to stop attacking the seasonal workers. They are a very important group. Every day we use or eat something that a seasonal worker worked at.\n\nObviously, the deficit was paid down on the backs of high unemployment regions, as the fund's surplus is $26 billion. However, people who are not eligible for employment insurance benefits go for weeks and months without any income.\n\nIt is clear, with a $26 billion surplus in the fund that we did not get that money where the EI was not being used. That money came from the regions where there was very high unemployment and people either did not qualify or went for two to three months with no income or got a $32 per week cheque. That is how we got that money.\n\nLet us not forget that, for every poor child, there are poor parents. In a country as rich as ours, this is unacceptable.\n\nWe also have to talk about health care, a program so important to all Canadians. I have done surveys and we can talk to any group. Our health care program is very important. We want to keep our health care program. Without increasing transfer payments to the provinces, health care services will continue to deteriorate. Our hospitals need more doctors, nurses and other health care workers. Canadians need this now. Lives are depending on the government's actions.\n\nThere was also no mention of our fishery crisis. It is a crisis. Our caucus was given a presentation by Mr. Christmas this morning. I was very shocked to hear that the first nations are negotiating to obtain actually between 30% and 50% of the Atlantic fishery. I wonder where the government is on this. This afternoon I made phone calls to different fishermen. I asked if they were aware that the aboriginal people had put on the table that they want 30% to 50% of the Atlantic fishery.\n\nI hope that finally the government will take some leadership and that it will talk to both groups. A lot of families are depending on that. I hope the government is going to do something because to do nothing is not an option at this point.",
